[{"question": "A ball of mass  m 1  is traveling with a horizontal velocity  v 0  and hits a second ball of mass  m 2 . This second ball is initially hanging on a vertical cord of length  L . What is the maximum height attained by the second ball when the collision between the two balls is perfectly elastic 2. Numerical application:  m1  = 0 . 1  kg,  m2  = 0 . 2  kg,  L  = 30  cm,  v 0  = 1  m/s.", "answer": "1. In an elastic collision, both the mechanical energy and momentum are conserved. Conservation of momentum in one dimension is m1 v1i  +  m2 v2i  =  m1 v1f  +  m2 v2f , (1) where the subscripts  i  and  f  indicate the state just before and just after the collision respectively and the subscripts  1  and  2  indicate the first or second ball respectively. Since the first ball has an initial speed of  v1i  =  v 0  and the second ball starts at rest  v2i  = 0 , equation (1) becomes m1 * v0  =  m1 *v1f  +  m2 *v2f . (2) Solving this equation for the final velocity of the first ball gives v1f  =  v0  - m2 / m1 *v2f . (3) We chose to solve for  v1f , rather than  v 2 f  because we are searching for  v 2 f  and substituting equation (3) into the conservation of energy equation will allow us to eliminate  v 1 f . Since the collision is elastic, mechanical energy is conserved during the collision and we can write m1 / 2  * v1i^2   +  m2/2   v2i^2   =  m1/2  * v1f^2   +  m2 / 2  * v2f^2. (4) Given the initial velocities of the two balls, this becomes m 1 /2  * v0^2   =  m1/ 2 *  v1f^2   +  m2/ 2 *  v2f^2 . (5) Substituting equation (3) into equation (5) allows us to eliminate  v1f : v2f  = 2m1/(m1+m2)*v0. \n To calculate the maximum height attained by the second ball after the collision, we can use conservation of mechanical energy. Since there are no non-conservative forces doing work, we have K 2 f  +  U 2 f  =  K 2 max  +  U 2 max (12) , where  K 2 max  and  U 2 max  are the kinetic and gravitational potential energies at the maximum height. Given that it is the maximum height, we know that  K 2 max  = 0 . Additionally, we can define the reference point for the gravitational potential to be at the height of the collision. Thus,  U 2 f  = 0 , implying that equation (12) becomes K 2 f  + 0 = 0 +  U 2 max \u21d2 (m1 +m2)/2  * vf^2   = (m1+m2)/ 2 gh max \u21d2 h max  =  1/2g * vf^2 . (13) Substituting equation (11) gives h max  =  1/2g ((2 m1)/(m1+m2)*v0)^2. Plugging in numbers, we find that h max  = 2 . 22  cm .", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "Two balls of mass  m 1  and  m 2  are released with no initial velocity from a height  h  as shown below. Ball 1 is directly beneath ball 2 and they are touching. During their fall, the balls stay in contact until they hit the ground. The situation can be described as an elastic collision between ball 1 and the ground, immediately followed by a collision between the two balls. Note that you can assume the radii of the balls are negligibly small, as is air drag. The collision between the two balls is perfectly elastic. What are the velocities of each ball immediately after the second collision? ", "answer": "Projectile motion of the descent:  Before the first collision, both balls experience projectile motion. By conservation of mechanical energy during the entire fall, we have 0 +  m 1 gh  =   m1/ 2  * v1f^2   + 0 and 0 +  m 2 gh  =   m 2 / 2 * v2f^2   + 0 , (1) where we will define  y  = 0  to be the ground and let  \u02c6 y  point upwards (as shown in the problem statement). Solving both these equations for the velocity just before impact with the ground v1f  =  v2f  =  \u00b1 p 2 gh  =  \u2212 p 2 gh  =  \u2212 v \u21d2 v  = p 2 gh (2) reveals that it is the same for both balls (which is expected as we know that objects fall at the same rate regardless of their mass). We chose the negative sign as we know that both balls are falling downwards in the  \u2212 \u02c6 y  direction. Additionally, we chose to define a new parameter  v  such that it is positive. Collision between ball 1 and the ground:  Next, ball 1 experiences an elastic collision with the ground. We have the intuition that the ball will maintain its speed and reverse its direction as a result of the collision, but this can be demonstrated rigorously. We start by writing requiring conservation of momentum m 1 v 1 i  +  M E v Ei  =  m 1 v 1 f  +  M E v Ef , (3) where the subscript  E  refers to the earth. We know that  v Ei  = 0  (given that we have taken a laboratory reference frame) and the velocity of ball 1 just before the collision is equal to its final velocity after projectile motion (i.e. equation (2)). Thus, we can find \u2212 m 1 v  + 0 =  m 1 v 1 f  +  M E v Ef \u21d2 v Ef  =  \u2212 m 1 M E ( v  +  v 1 f )  . (4) Since the collision is elastic, we can also enforce conservation of mechanical energy m 1/ 2 *  v2  + 0 =  m 1 ^/2 *v1f^2   +  M E/ 2  * vEf^2 . (5) Substituting equation (4) shows that m 1 2   v 2  =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  M E 2 \u0012  m 1 M E ( v  +  v 1 f ) \u0013 2 \u21d2 m 1 2 \u0000 v 2   \u2212 v 2 1 f \u0001 =   m 1 M E m 1 2  ( v  +  v 1 f ) 2  . (6) Crucially, we see that the right-hand side of the equation has a factor of  m 1 /M E , while the left-hand side does not. Since the earth is  much  more massive than the ball, we know that  m 1 /M E  \u226a 1  and we can neglect the right-hand side of the equation. Thus, we find that ball 1 has a velocity of m 1 2 \u0000 v 2   \u2212 v 2 1 f \u0001 = 0 \u21d2 v 2 1 f   =  v 2  = 2 gh \u21d2 v 1 f  =  \u00b1 p 2 gh  = p 2 gh  =  v (7) after colliding with the ground, where we\u2019ve used equation (2) and chosen the plus sign (as the ball must change direction to avoid passing through the earth). Thus, we\u2019ve found that, before the two balls collide, ball 1 has a velocity of  v  =   \u221a 2 gh , while ball 2 still has a velocity of  \u2212 v  =  \u2212 \u221a 2 gh . Collision between ball 1 and ball 2:  Now the two balls collide elastically with one another. In class, we derived the general formulas for the velocities that result from an elastic collision between two 3 objects in one dimension. This derivation was streamlined to minimize the math, but was not intuitive. You are free to simply use the formulas we found. Here we present a more intuitive derivation that, as a result, is considerably more messy (even for the case considered here of identical initial speeds). Enforcing conservation of momentum and using the final velocities from the previous part gives m 1 v 1 i  + m 2 v 2 i  =  m 1 v 1 f  + m 2 v 2 f \u21d2 m 1 v  \u2212 m 2 v  =  m 1 v 1 f  + m 2 v 2 f \u21d2 v 1 f  =   m 1  \u2212 m 2 m 1 v  \u2212 m 2 m 1 v 2 f . (8) Since the collision is elastic, we enforce conservation of mechanical energy m 1 2   v 2 1 i   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 i   =  m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f \u21d2 m 1  +  m 2 2 v 2   =   m 1 2   v 2 1 f   +  m 2 2   v 2 2 f . (9) Substituting equation (8) and simplifying produces m 1  +  m 2 2 v 2   =   m 1 2 \u0012 m 1  \u2212 m 2 m 1 v  \u2212 m 2 m 1 v 2 f \u0013 2 +   m 2 2   v 2 2 f (10) ( m 1  +  m 2 )  v 2   =  m 1   ( m 1  \u2212 m 2 ) 2 m 2 1 v 2   \u2212 2 m 1 m 2  \u2212 m 2 2 m 2 1 vv 2 f  +   m 2 2 m 2 1 v 2 2 f ! +  m 2 v 2 2 f (11) \u0000 m 2 1   +  m 1 m 2 \u0001 v 2   = \u0000 m 2 1   \u2212 2 m 1 m 2   +  m 2 2 \u0001 v 2   \u2212 2 \u0000 m 1 m 2  \u2212 m 2 2 \u0001 vv 2 f  +  m 2 2 v 2 2 f   +  m 1 m 2 v 2 2 f (12) 0 = \u0000 m 2 2   \u2212 3 m 1 m 2 \u0001 v 2   \u2212 2 \u0000 m 1 m 2  \u2212 m 2 2 \u0001 vv 2 f  + \u0000 m 2 2   +  m 1 m 2 \u0001 v 2 2 f .

(16) We see that the solution with the minus sign gives  v 2 f  =  \u2212 v , which is identical to the initial velocity of ball 2. Thus, the physical solution must be the plus sign, which gives v 2 f  =  v   3 m 1  \u2212 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 = p 2 gh 3 m 1  \u2212 m 2 m 1  +  m 2 (17) using equation (2).

The cannonball lands a distance of  P  = 40  km away. The recoil of the cannon is absorbed by a spring with a stiffness of  k  = 10 5   N/m that is at its equilibrium position before the shot is fired. Neglect friction, air drag, and small variations in gravitational potential energy due to the cannon\u2019s motion. 1. How far does the spring compress during the shot?", "answer": "As a result of the explosion, the entire cannon moves backwards and the spring compresses. The energy of the system is comprised of kinetic  K  and spring potential energy  U s . We will ignore any small change in the elevation of the cannon, thereby neglecting the gravitational potential energy  U g . Given that energy is always conserved, we have K i  +  U si  =  K f  +  U sf . (1) We will take the initial state to be the moment immediately after the explosion, when the cannon is moving at its maximum speed  V 0 , but the spring is still at its equilibrium position. For the final state, we will take the moment when the spring has its maximum displacement  \u2206 x max  and the cannon has come to a temporary rest. Thus, equation (1) becomes M/2 * V0^2  + 0 = 0 +  k/2 \u2206 xmax^2 max, \u2206 x max  = sqrt(M / k) * V0 . (2) Unfortunately, we do not know the initial speed of the cannon  V 0 . To find this, we must use the information given in the problem statement about the dynamics of the cannonball. To relate the dynamics of the cannon to that of the cannonball, we can use conservation of momentum. Given that the cannon-cannonball system is initially at rest, conservation of momentum is 0 =  mv 0 \u02c6 u  \u2212 MV 0 \u02c6 u \u21d2 V 0  =   m M  v 0 , (3) where  v 0  is the initial velocity of the cannonball and the  \u02c6 u  direction is defined in the diagram above. Substituting this into equation (2) yields \u2206 x max  = m \u221a kM v 0 .

We will define the origin of the coordinate system to be the cannon, such that the cannonball is at  x 0  = 0  and y 0  = 0  when the cannon fires at  t  = 0 . Given the information in the problem statement, we know that v 0 x  =  v 0  cos  \u03b1  and  v 0 y  =  v 0  sin  \u03b1 . Thus, equations (5) and (6) become x ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  \u03b1 (7) y ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  sin  \u03b1. (8) At some time  t  =  t f , we know that the cannonball will land at the location x ( t f ) =  P  =  v 0 t f  cos  \u03b1 \u21d2 t f  = P v 0  cos  \u03b1 (9) y ( t f ) = 0 =  \u2212 g 2 t 2 f   +  v 0 t f   sin  \u03b1 \u21d2 0 =  \u2212 g 2 t f  +  v 0  sin  \u03b1 \u21d2 t f  =  2 g  v 0  sin  \u03b1. (10) Equating equations (9) and (10) gives P v 0  cos  \u03b1   = 2 g  v 0  sin  \u03b1 \u21d2 v 0  = r gP 2 sin  \u03b1  cos  \u03b1 .

", "answer": "The initial speed of the projectile is equal to the magnitude of its escape velocity. Given the definition of escape velocity, this can be found from the condition that K 0  +  U G 0  = 0 , (1) where the subscript  0  indicates the initial value and  U G  indicates the general gravitational potential (which is distinct from the gravitational potential near the earth\u2019s surface  U g  =  mgy ). We can calculate U G  from the form of the gravitational force between the two objects \u20d7 F G ( r ) =  \u2212 GmM e r 2 \u02c6 r.

However, we see that, since the force is purely radial, only the change in radial position matters. Thus, we can write \u2206 U G  =  U G ( R )  \u2212 U G ( \u221e ) = Z  R \u221e GmM e r 2 dr.

(5) Since the reference point for the potential energy is at  R  =  \u221e (i.e. we define the potential energy such that  U ( \u221e ) = 0 ), equation (5) implies that U G ( R ) =  \u2212 GmM e R . (6) Substituting this into equation (1) allows us to find the initial speed of the projectile when it is launched m 2   v 2 0   \u2212 GmM e R e = 0 \u21d2 v 0  = r 2 GM e R e , (7) where  R  =  R e  is the initial position. 2. Since all the forces are conservative, mechanical energy is conserved and we have K c  +  U Gc  =  K 0  +  U G 0 , (8) where the subscript  c  indicates the value just before the collision. Therefore, we can use equations (1) and (6) to write equation (8) as K c  +  U Gc  = 0 \u21d2 m 2   v 2 c   \u2212 GmM e 2 R e = 0 \u21d2 v c  = r GM e R e (9) at the location just before the collision  R c  = 2 R e . 10 3. Drawing a free body diagram for the satellite and using the gravitational force given by equation (2), we see that Newton\u2019s second law in the  \u02c6 r  direction is \u2212 GmM e (2 R e ) 2  =  \u2212 m \u0012  v 2 s 2 R e \u0013 , (10) where we have used the form of the centripetal acceleration and  v s  is the speed of the satellite. Solving this equation for the speed gives v s  = r GM e 2 R e . (11) 4. Given the the collision happens quickly, we can use the impulse approximation to ignore the effect of gravity  during  the collision. Thus, momentum is conserved throughout the collision, so we can write m\u20d7 v pi  +  m\u20d7 v si  =  m\u20d7 v pf  +  m\u20d7 v sf \u21d2 \u20d7 v pi  +  \u20d7 v si  =  \u20d7 v pf  +  \u20d7 v sf , (12) where the subscript  p  indicates the projectile, the subscript  s  indicates the satellite, the subscript i  indicates the value just before the collision, and the subscript  f  indicates the value just after the collision. Since the collision is purely inelastic and the objects stick together, instead of conservation of energy, we require that the final velocities of the projectile and satellite be the same \u20d7 v pf  =  \u20d7 v sf  =  \u20d7 v f . (13) We will adopt a polar coordinate system, such that the projectile is moving in the  \u02c6 r  direction before the collision and the satellite is moving in the   \u02c6 \u03d5  direction before the collision. From our solutions to parts 2 and 3 of this problem, we see that  \u20d7 v pi  =  v c \u02c6 r  = p GM e /R e \u02c6 r  and  \u20d7 v si  =  v s   \u02c6 \u03d5  = p GM e / (2 R e ) \u02c6 \u03d5 . Substituting these initial values and equation (13) into equation (12), we find the final velocity of the combined projectile-satellite object to be r GM e R e \u02c6 r  + r GM e 2 R e \u02c6 \u03d5  = 2 \u20d7 v f \u21d2 \u20d7 v f  =  1 2  r GM e R e \u02c6 r  + r GM e 2 R e \u02c6 \u03d5 ! .

This time interval  \u2206 t  is straightforward to calculate as the particles are a distance  d  apart and travel at a constant velocity of  v . Thus, immediately after one hits, the time before the next one hits will be equal to the time it takes a particle to travel a distance  d . This gives d  =  v \u2206 t \u21d2 \u2206 t  =   d v  .

There is no friction between the ladder and the wall. What is the maximum possible angle  \u03b1 m  before the foot of the ladder begins to slip and the ladder falls down? How does it depend on  m ?

Equations (2) and (3) represent a system of two equations, but we have three unknowns:  N 1 ,  N 2 , and  F f (we know the maximum value of the friction force is  F   max f =  \u00b5N 1 , but we don\u2019t know how  F f  depends on \u03b1 ). To solve the problem, we must consider the torque on the ladder  \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7   \u20d7 F . In equilibrium, the ladder does not turn, so the net torque must be zero. We choose the center of mass of the ladder (i.e. the origin in the above diagram) to be the pivot point. Then, we write down the net torque about this point from all the forces in the problem \u20d7 \u03c4 net  = X \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u20d7 r g  \u00d7   \u20d7 F g  +  \u20d7 r N 1  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 1  +  \u20d7 r N 2  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 2  +  \u20d7 r f  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  = 0 , (4) where the position vectors go  from  the pivot point  to  the point of application of the force (as shown in the above diagram). Given that the position vector for the gravitational force is  \u20d7 r g  = 0 , we find \u20d7 r N 1  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 1  +  \u20d7 r N 2  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 2  +  \u20d7 r f  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  = 0 . (5) The magnitude of all the other position vectors is  | \u20d7 r N 1 |  =  | \u20d7 r N 2 |  =  | \u20d7 r f |  =  L/ 2 . Using the right-hand rule for the cross product, we can determine the direction of each term in equation (5). Each one is in the  \u02c6 z direction, however the sign is positive for   \u20d7 N 1  and negative for   \u20d7 F f  and   \u20d7 N 2 . Next, we can use the cross product definition that   \u20d7 A  \u00d7   \u20d7 B  =  |   \u20d7 A ||   \u20d7 B |  sin  \u03b8  =  AB  sin  \u03b8  (where  \u03b8  is the angle between   \u20d7 A  and   \u20d7 B ).

(6) Using the trigonometric identity that  sin ( \u03c0/ 2  \u2212 \u03b1 ) = cos  \u03b1  gives N 1  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 N 2  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F f  cos  \u03b1  = 0 . (7) This is the third equation that we need to solve our system of equations. Thus, we substitute equations (2) and (3) to obtain mg  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 F f  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F f  cos  \u03b1  = 0 \u21d2 F f  =   mg 2  tan  \u03b1.

We will quantify the positions of the car and counterweight ( x 2  and  y 1  respectively) using the coordinate systems shown in the diagram below. 2 \u03b8 R m 1 m 2 m p x 2 y 1 We will choose the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be at the height of the center of the pulley, which we see is at  x 2  = 0  and  y 1  = 0 . The initial mechanical energy is only the gravitational potential energy of the car and counterweight (as the center of mass of the pulley is at the reference point of the gravitational potential). Thus, we have E mi  =  U gi  =  \u2212 m 1 gy 1 i  \u2212 m 2 gx 2 i  sin  \u03b8, (2) where  y 1 i  is the initial position of the counterweight and  x 2 i  is the initial position of the car. After the cart has moved by a distance  d , the mechanical energy is composed of the gravitational potential energy of the car and counterweight, the translational kinetic energy of the car and counterweight, and the rotational kinetic energy of the pulley. This can be written as E mf  =  U gf  +  K f  = ( \u2212 m 1 gy 1  \u2212 m 2 gx 2  sin  \u03b8 ) + \u0012 m 1 2   v 2 1   +  m 2 2   v 2 2   +  I p 2   \u03c9 2 \u0013 , (3) where  x 2  and  y 1  are the locations of the car and counterweight respectively,  v 1  and  v 2  are the speeds of the counterweight and car respectively, and  \u03c9  is the angular speed of the pulley. Since the rope is inextensible and directly connects the two blocks, the car and the counterweight (as well as every point of the rope) move at the same speed. This is the constraint condition, which is expressed as v  =  v 1  =  v 2 . (4) Since the rope does not slip on the pulley, the points on the outer rim of the pulley move with a tangential speed  v \u03d5  equal to the speed of the rope, car, and counterweight v \u03d5  =  R\u03c9  =  v \u21d2 \u03c9  =   v R .

(7) The external torque  \u20d7 \u03c4 a  does not appear. This is because a torque alone exerts no net translational force on the system. In other words, a torque is composed of a set of forces that impart rotational motion, but no translational motion (because the arrangement of forces are such that they cancel when summed). An example of such a set of forces is the two green forces with magnitude  F a  in the above figure. These would create a torque  \u20d7 \u03c4 a , but not affect the translational motion. Substituting the five forces from equations (3) through (7) into equation (1) gives N 1  sin  \u03b8  \u2212 N 2  sin  \u03b8  \u2212 F f 1  cos  \u03b8  \u2212 F f 2  cos  \u03b8  = 0 (8) in the  \u02c6 x  direction and \u2212 mg  +  N 1  cos  \u03b8  +  N 2  cos  \u03b8  +  F f 1  sin  \u03b8  \u2212 F f 2  sin  \u03b8  = 0 (9) in the  \u02c6 y  direction.

To simplify the math we will use the fact that  \u03b8  = 45 \u25e6 (though this can be introduced at any point in the problem). Equations (10) and (11) become N 1  =  N 2 1 +  \u00b5 1  \u2212 \u00b5 (12) N 1 1 +  \u00b5 1  \u2212 \u00b5   +  N 2  = \u221a 2 mg 1  \u2212 \u00b5  .

(16) Note that the normal forces  N 1  and  N 2  are different. This is due to the rotation of the cylinder and the kinetic friction force. Looking at the free body diagram above, we see that it is not quite left-right mirror symmetric. Specifically, both of the kinetic friction forces point to the left. This fact means that one cannot assume that  N 1  =  N 2 . Instead one must calculate them, which indeed reveals that they are different. 5 Finally, to find the externally applied torque  \u20d7 \u03c4 a , we must employ equation (2). We will choose the pivot point to be the axis of rotation of the cylinder. Thus, the torque  \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7   \u20d7 F  arising from a force   \u20d7 F  depends on the position vector  \u20d7 r  from the axis of rotation to the point of application of the force. For the two normal forces, this is  \u20d7 \u03c4 N 1  =  \u20d7 r N 1  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 1  =  \u20d7 \u03c4 N 2  =  \u20d7 r N 2  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 2  = 0  as the cross product of parallel (or anti-parallel) vectors is zero. Additionally, since the gravitational force is applied at the center of mass of the system, its position vector is  \u20d7 r g  = 0 , which means the torque it creates is  \u20d7 \u03c4 g  = 0  as well. Thus, we have three non-zero torques about the axis of rotation of the cylinder: the externally applied torque  \u20d7 \u03c4 a  and torques from the two frictional forces  \u20d7 \u03c4 f 1  and  \u20d7 \u03c4 f 2 . This means equation (2) can be written as X \u20d7 \u03c4 ext  =  \u20d7 \u03c4 a  +  \u20d7 \u03c4 f 1  +  \u20d7 \u03c4 f 2  =  \u20d7 \u03c4 a  +  \u20d7 r f 1  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f 1  +  \u20d7 r f 2  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f 2  =  \u20d7 \u03c4 a  \u2212 r f 1 F f 1 \u02c6 z  \u2212 r f 2 F f 2 \u02c6 z  = 0 , (17) where we have used the definition of a torque  \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7   \u20d7 F , the fact that the frictional forces are perpendicular to the position vectors, and the right-hand rule to evaluate the direction of the cross product. Substituting the form of the frictional force as well as equations (15) and (16) gives \u20d7 \u03c4 a  =  R  ( \u00b5N 1  +  \u00b5N 2 ) \u02c6 z  =  R \u0012 \u00b5 mg \u221a 2 1 +  \u00b5 1 +  \u00b5 2  +  \u00b5mg \u221a 2 1  \u2212 \u00b5 1 +  \u00b5 2 \u0013 \u02c6 z  = \u221a 2 mg\u00b5R 1 +  \u00b5 2  \u02c6 z, (18) where we also note that the distance to the point of application of the frictional forces is  r f 1  =  r f 2  =  R .

Since an integral is just a sum of infinitesimal elements, we can divide the integral into the sum of integrals over the two parts of the system according to I tot P =  I rod P +  I disk P , (2) where I rod P = Z rod \u03c1 2 dm (3) and I disk P = Z disk \u03c1 2 dm. (4) We will first calculate  I disk P . Using the parallel axis theorem, we can relate the moment of inertia of the disk about point P  I disk P to its moment of inertia about its center of mass  I disk CM   according to I disk P =  I disk CM   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (5) The moment of inertia of a disk about its center of mass can be found from a table, which is perfectly acceptable. However, here we will show how to derive it from the definition of the moment of inertia I disk CM   = Z disk \u03c1 2 dm, (6) 6 where  \u03c1  is the distance from the center of mass of the disk.

We can use  \u03c3  to rewrite the integral over mass in equation (6) as an integral over area according to I disk CM   = Z disk \u03c1 2 \u03c3dA. (8) While the differential area is  dA  =  dxdy  in Cartesian coordinates, we would like to use polar coordinates to reflect the geometry of the disk. In polar coordinates  dA  =  \u03c1d\u03d5d\u03c1 , which you can see by calculating the area of a differential element with a small extent in radius  \u03c1  and angle  \u03d5 .

(15) Thus, the integral over the entire rod is just I rod P =  \u03bb Z  L 1 0 \u03c1 2 d\u03c1  =  \u03bb \u0012 L 3 1 3   \u2212 0 \u0013 =   m 1 3   L 2 1 . (16) Substituting this and equation (12) into equation (2) gives the final answer of I tot P =   m 1 3   L 2 1   +  m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 . (17) 7 2. The center of mass of any system is given by \u20d7 R CM  = P i   m i \u20d7 r i P i   m i . (18) Here our system has two objects: the rod and the disk. Given that the rod is uniform, we know that its center of mass is at its midpoint, which is a distance  L 1 / 2  from the point P. Similarly, since the disk is uniform, its center of mass is at its geometric center, which is a distance  L 2  from the axis P. The calculation is one dimensional as both of these distances are in the same direction (i.e. along the length of the rod). Plugging this information into equation (18) gives a distance of R CM  =   m 1 ( L 1 / 2) +  m 2 ( L 2 ) m 1  +  m 2 =   m 1 L 1 / 2 +  m 2 L 2 m 1  +  m 2 . (19) 3. As all of the forces acting on the pendulum system are conservative, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy E mi  =  E mf (20) between the initial state described in the problem (denoted by the subscript  i ) and the final state when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing (denoted by the subscript  f ). The only forces involved are gravity, so equation (20) is K i  +  U gi  =  K f  +  U gf . (21) The system is released from rest, so  K i  = 0 . Additionally, we will define the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be the location of the center of mass when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing, so  U gf  = 0 . Thus, we can use the forms of the rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy to write equation (21) as 0 + ( m 1  +  m 2 )  g \u2206 h  =   I tot P 2   \u03c9 2 f   + 0 , (22) where  \u2206 h  is the change in height of the center of mass from its final position to its initial position and  \u03c9 f  is the angular speed that we are trying to find. From the picture below, we see that  \u2206 h  = R CM  \u2212 R CM  cos  \u03b8 0 . Substituting this into equation (22) along with equations (17) and (19) gives ( m 1  +  m 2 )  g  ( R CM  \u2212 R CM  cos  \u03b8 0 ) =  1 2 \u0010 m 1 3   L 2 1   +  m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 \u0011 \u03c9 2 f (23) \u21d2 g \u0010 m 1 2   L 1  +  m 2 L 2 \u0011 (1  \u2212 cos  \u03b8 0 ) =  1 2 \u0010 m 1 3   L 2 1   +  m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 \u0011 \u03c9 2 f (24) \u21d2 \u03c9 f  = s 2 g \u0000  m 1 2   L 1  +  m 2 L 2 \u0001 (1  \u2212 cos  \u03b8 0 ) m 1 3   L 2 1   +  m 2 2   r 2 2   +  m 2 L 2 2 .

The gravitational force (which acts at the beam\u2019s center of mass), the tension force from the rope (which acts at the point of connection between the rope and the beam), and the normal force from the wall (which acts at the point of contact between the wall and the beam).

The point of application of the tension is shown in the problem statement to be  \u20d7 r T  = (3 L/ 4)\u02c6 x .

Thus, since the total external torque on the instrument about the center of the planet is zero, its angular momentum about the center of the planet must be conserved throughout its motion. Conservation of angular momentum is expressed as \u20d7 L i  =   \u20d7 L f , (3) where the angular momentum is \u20d7 L  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7  \u20d7 p  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7  m i \u20d7 v.

We realize that the instrument will be accelerated as it falls into the gravitational potential of the planet. The change in speed of the instrument can be found from conservation of mechanical energy because there are no nonconservative forces acting on the instrument.

What is the locomotive\u2019s final speed  v f  relative to the ground ?", "answer": "We begin by choosing our system to consist of the locomotive and the track. Because there are no  external torques about the central vertical axis, the angular momentum of our system must remain constant about that axis \u20d7 L i sys   =  \u20d7 L f sys . (1) The initial angular momentum of the system is \u20d7 L i sys   = 0 (2) because both the locomotive and the track are at rest. The final angular momentum will be composed of the angular momentum of the locomotive and the track according to \u20d7 L f sys   =  \u20d7 L f L   +  \u20d7 L f T   , (3) where the subscripts  L  and  T  refer to the locomotive and track respectively. The final angular momentum of the locomotive (which can be considered to be a point mass) is given by \u20d7 L f L   =  \u20d7 R L  \u00d7  \u20d7 p L  =  R T  \u02c6 r  \u00d7  m L \u20d7 v L , (4) where  \u20d7 r L  is the position vector from the pivot point at the top of the vertical axis to the locomotive,  \u20d7 p L  is momentum of the locomotive in the ground reference frame, and  \u20d7 v L  is the velocity of the locomotive relative to the ground.

The motion of any rigid body can be represented as the motion of the center of mass, plus a rotation about the center of mass. In problem set 6, we found the position of the center of mass after the collision to be \u20d7 R CM ( t ) =   V 0 2   t \u02c6 x  +   \u2113 4  \u02c6 y. (1) However, to completely specify the motion of the particle-rod system, we must also calculate the angular velocity of rotation of the system  about its center of mass . To calculate the rotation after the collision from the information just before the collision, we will use conservation of angular momentum about the center of mass (as there are no external torques acting on the particle-rod system). This is expressed as \u20d7 L b  =   \u20d7 L a . (2) where the subscript \u201cb\u201d indicates that the quantity is evaluated just before the collision and the subscript \u201ca\u201d indicates just after. Just before the collision, the angular momentum of the system about the center of mass is the sum of the angular momenta of all the objects  i  in the system. This is \u20d7 L b  = X i \u20d7 L ib  = X i \u20d7 r ib  \u00d7  m i \u20d7 v ib  =  \u20d7 r pb  \u00d7  M\u20d7 v pb , (3) where the subscript \u201cp\u201d indicates the particle. Note that there is no contribution to the angular momentum from the rod as it is completely stationary before the collision. From inspecting the problem statement we see that, just before the collision, the particle is moving with  \u20d7 v pb  =  V 0 \u02c6 x  at a position  \u20d7 r pb  =  \u2212 ( \u2113/ 4)\u02c6 y  relative to the center of mass of the particle-rod system at  t  = 0 . Substituting these values, equation (3) becomes \u20d7 L b  =   M 4   \u2113V 0 \u02c6 z. (4) After the collision, the rod and particle form a combined object that rotates at a common angular velocity  \u20d7 \u03c9  about its center of mass. The angular momentum of such an rotating extended object is \u20d7 L a  =  I CM \u20d7 \u03c9, (5) where  I CM  is the momentum of inertia of the particle-rod system about its center of mass. Substituting this and equation (4) into equation (2) allows us to find \u20d7 \u03c9  = M 4 I CM \u2113V 0 \u02c6 z. (6) This is almost the final solution, but we don\u2019t yet know  I CM . To calculate it, we start from the definition of the center of mass I CM  = Z M \u03c1 2 dm, (7) where the integral is taken over the entire mass of the combined object. Because integrals are just summations of infinitesimally small differential elements, we can separate it into the contributions from the two objects I CM  = Z rod \u03c1 2 dm  + Z particle \u03c1 2 dm  =  I rod  +  I particle . (8) 4 Angular momentum - 12 Since the particle is well represented by a point mass, all of its mass is located at the same distance \u03c1  =  \u2113/ 4  from the center of mass.

(9) There are two ways to find the contribution to the moment of inertia from the rod. This first is simpler and uses the parallel axis theorem. From the table of moments of inertia presented in lecture, we know that a uniform thin rod rotated about its center of mass (i.e. its geometric center) has a moment of inertia of  I center rod =  M\u2113 2 / 12 . However, we are interested in the rotation of the rod about the center of mass of the particle-rod system, not the center of mass of the rod alone. From equation (1), we see that the center of mass of the rod (which is at  ( \u2113/ 2)\u02c6 y ) is a distance of  h  =  \u2113/ 4  away from the center of mass of the particle-rod system at  t  = 0 . Thus, we will use the parallel axis theorem to see that I rod  =  I center rod +  Mh 2   =  1 12 M\u2113 2  + 1 16 M\u2113 2  = 7 48 M\u2113 2 . (10) The second way to find the moment of inertia of the rod is to directly evaluate the integral in equation (8). This approach is more challenging, but applies to a wider variety of situations. To convert from an integral over mass to an integral in space, we use the linear mass density  \u03bb  =  dm/d\u03c1  and the fact that the density is uniform  \u03bb  =  M/\u2113 to see that  dm  = ( M/\u2113 ) d\u03c1 . Substituting this we see that I rod  = Z rod \u03c1 2 dm  =   M \u2113 Z rod \u03c1 2 d\u03c1. (11) To determine the bounds of the integral, we must think about the geometry of the problem. Here  \u03c1 represents the distance from the center of mass of the particle-rod system, which is at  y  =  \u2113/ 4 . Thus, to integrate over the full object we must consider the part of the rod above and below the center of mass, which is tricky as some of these points have the same value of  \u03c1 . This can be handled by splitting the integral into the contributions above and below, which are given by I rod  =   M \u2113 Z  3 \u2113/ 4 0 \u03c1 2 d\u03c1  +   M \u2113 Z  \u2113/ 4 0 \u03c1 2 d\u03c1. (12) respectively. Evaluting the integrals is straightforward and yields I rod  =   M \u2113 \u0012 \u03c1 3 3 \u0015 \u03c1 =3 \u2113/ 4 \u03c1 =0 +   M \u2113 \u0012 \u03c1 3 3 \u0015 \u03c1 = \u2113/ 4 \u03c1 =0 =   M 3 \u2113 \u0012 3 4 \u2113 \u0013 3 +   M 3 \u2113 \u0012 1 4 \u2113 \u0013 3 =  1 3 \u0012 27 64  + 1 64 \u0013 M\u2113 2   =  7 48 M\u2113 2 , (13) which is identical to the solution using the parallel axis theorem (i.e. equation (10)). Substituting equation (9) and (13) into equation (8) gives the total moment of inertia of the particle-rod system around its center of mass, which is I CM  =  7 48 M\u2113 2  + 1 16 M\u2113 2  = 5 24 M\u2113 2 . (14) Substituting this into equation (6) gives the final answer of \u20d7 \u03c9  =  6 5 V 0 \u2113 \u02c6 z. (15) Importantly, since there are no additional forces acting at later times, we have conservation of angular momentum. Thus, the angular velocity of the particle-rod system remains the same at all times  t  \u2265 0 . 5 Angular momentum - 12 2. We know that the particle-rod system moves based on the combination of two types of motion. Its center of mass translates, which has been calculated in equation (1). Additionally, in the center of mass reference frame, all points in the system rotate about the center of mass with a constant angular velocity  \u20d7 \u03c9  = (6 / 5)( V 0 /\u2113 )\u02c6 z . This rotation is uniform circular motion, so the angular velocity corresponds to a velocity of \u20d7 v  =  \u20d7 \u03c9  \u00d7  \u20d7 \u03c1  =  \u03c9 \u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u03c1 \u02c6 \u03c1  =  \u03c1\u03c9   \u02c6 \u03d5. (16) We are asked about the position of the particle, which is located at a distance  \u03c1  =  \u2113/ 4  away from the center of mass. Thus, it has a velocity of \u20d7 v  =   \u2113 4 \u03c9  \u02c6 \u03d5 (17) after the collision. Note that if we substitute the value for  \u03c9 , we find  \u20d7 v  = (6 / 20) V 0   \u02c6 \u03d5 , which shows that the particle is slowed down substantially as a result of the collision. Ultimately, we want to express the position in Cartesian coordinates, so we will convert the cylindrical unit vector   \u02c6 \u03d5  according to \u20d7 v  =   \u2113 4 \u03c9  ( \u2212 sin  \u03d5 \u02c6 x  + cos  \u03d5 \u02c6 y )  . (18) Given that  \u03c9  is constant, we can integrate the definition of the angular speed   \u02d9 \u03d5  =  \u03c9  to find \u03d5 ( t ) =  \u03c9t  +  C, (19) where  C  is an integration constant. Since  \u03d5  is the angle from the  + x -axis and increases towards the + y -axis, at  t  = 0  the particle is at  \u03d5 (0) =  \u2212 \u03c0/ 2 . Using this initial condition, we find that  C  =  \u2212 \u03c0/ 2 . Substituting this and equation (19) into equation (18) gives \u20d7 v ( t ) =   \u2113 4 \u03c9 \u0010 \u2212 sin \u0010 \u03c9t  \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u0011 \u02c6 x  + cos \u0010 \u03c9t  \u2212 \u03c0 2 \u0011 \u02c6 y \u0011 =   \u2113 4 \u03c9  (cos ( \u03c9t ) \u02c6 x  + sin ( \u03c9t ) \u02c6 y )  , (20) where in the second step we have used trigonometric identities that one can find in a table. This result is consistent with our intuition \u2013 the bottom of the rod should start rotating to the right, in the same direction the particle strikes it. To find the position, we simply integrate equation (20) to find \u20d7 r ( t ) =   \u2113 4  (sin ( \u03c9t ) \u02c6 x  \u2212 cos ( \u03c9t ) \u02c6 y )  . (21) However, we must remember that the position  \u20d7 r ( t )  is in the reference frame moving with the center of mass of the particle-rod system. Thus, we must change back to the reference frame given in the problem statement using   \u20d7 R p ( t ) =   \u20d7 R CM ( t ) +  \u20d7 r ( t ) . This yields the final answer of \u20d7 R p ( t ) =   \u20d7 R CM ( t ) +   \u2113 4  (sin( \u03c9t )\u02c6 x  \u2212 cos( \u03c9t )\u02c6 y )  .

", "answer": "In the vertical direction, the ring experiences only gravity and the normal force and does not accelerate. Thus, the vertical component of Newton\u2019s second law for the ring tells us that N  \u2212 mg  = 0 \u21d2 N  =  mg. (1) 6 Angular momentum - 12 In the horizontal direction, kinetic friction causes a force \u20d7 F f  =  \u2212 \u00b5N  \u02c6 x  =  \u2212 \u00b5mg \u02c6 x, (2) where we have defined the direction of motion of the ring to be the  \u02c6 x  direction. Since this is the only horizontal force on the ring, Newton\u2019s second law in the  \u02c6 x  direction tells us that the corresponding acceleration is constant and has a value of F fx  =  ma \u21d2 \u2212 \u00b5mg  =  ma \u21d2 a  =  \u2212 \u00b5g. (3) According to the work-kinetic energy theorem, the change in kinetic energy is equal to the work done by friction. Since the disk starts out with kinetic energy  K i  =  E 0  and finishes at rest with  K f  = 0 , we know that \u2206 K  =  W \u21d2 K f  \u2212 K i  = Z \u20d7 F f  \u00b7  d \u20d7 l \u21d2 0  \u2212 E 0  = Z  \u2206 x 0 \u2212 \u00b5mg \u02c6 x  \u00b7  (\u02c6 xdx ) \u21d2 E 0  =  \u00b5mg \u2206 x,  (4) where  \u2206 x  is the total distance traveled by the ring and we have used equation (2). The ring undergoes motion under constant acceleration, so we can immediately write down its velocity as v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0  =  \u2212 \u00b5gt  +  v 0 , (5) where we have used equation (3). We can use this to find the time at which the ring will stop, which gives v ( t 1 ) = 0 =  \u2212 \u00b5gt 1  +  v 0 \u21d2 t 1  =   v 0 \u00b5g  . (6) To calculate the initial velocity, we can use the formula for the translational kinetic energy and find K  =   m 2   v 2 \u21d2 K i  =  E 0  =   m 2   v 2 0 \u21d2 v 0  = r 2 E 0 m  . (7) Substituting this into equation (6) gives the final answer of t 1  =  1 \u00b5g r 2 E 0 m  . (8) Alternative solution: Kinetic friction causes a horizontal force, which will reduce the momentum of the ring. Let the initial velocity of the ring be  \u20d7 v 0  =  v 0 \u02c6 x , directed along the horizontal axis  x . The initial momentum and kinetic energy of the ring are \u20d7 p 0  =  mv 0 \u02c6 x (9) K i  =  E 0  =   m 2   v 2 0 (10) respectively. Solving equation (10) for  v 0  and plugging it into equation (9) gives \u20d7 p 0  =  m r 2 E 0 m   \u02c6 x  = p 2 mE 0 \u02c6 x. (11) The only net horizontal force on the ring arises from kinetic friction, which is given by equation (2). This force   \u20d7 F f  is constant. Thus, the generalized version of Newton\u2019s second law,  d\u20d7 p/dt  =   \u20d7 F , can be integrated to show that \u20d7 p ( t ) =   \u20d7 F f t  +  \u20d7 p 0  = \u0010 \u2212 \u00b5mgt  + p 2 mE 0 \u0011 \u02c6 x (12) 7 Angular momentum - 12 using equations (2) and (11). From this we can find the time at which the ring comes to rest to be \u20d7 p ( t 1 ) = 0 = \u0010 \u2212 \u00b5mgt 1  + p 2 mE 0 \u0011 \u02c6 x \u21d2 t 1  = 1 \u00b5mg p 2 mE 0 \u21d2 t 1  =  1 \u00b5g r 2 E 0 m  , (13) which is consistent with equation (8) . 2. For the rest of this problem, we use a cylindrical coordinate system  ( \u03c1, \u03d5, z )  with its origin  O at the center of the ring and the vertical  \u02c6 z  direction pointing  downwards . Friction results in a vertical torque, which will reduce the angular momentum of the ring with time. We will first calculate the initial angular momentum and then find the strength of the torque to determine how quickly it will come to rest. Let  \u20d7 \u03c9 0  =  \u03c9 0 \u02c6 z  be the initial angular velocity with  \u02c6 z  defined to be downwards such that  \u03c9 0  >  0 . The initial angular momentum about pivot point  O  is then \u20d7 L 0  =  I\u20d7 \u03c9 0  =  I\u03c9 0 \u02c6 z, (14) where  I  is the moment of inertia about the  \u02c6 z  axis. The initial kinetic energy of the ring is its rotational kinetic energy, which can be used to find the initial angular velocity to be K i  =  E 0  =   I 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u21d2 \u03c9 0  =  \u00b1 r 2 E 0 I \u21d2 \u03c9 0  = r 2 E 0 I  . (15) Here we have used the fact that  \u03c9 0  >  0  to choose the positive sign in front of the square root. We can plug equation (15) into equation (14) to obtain \u20d7 L 0  =  I r 2 E 0 I \u02c6 z  = p 2 IE 0 \u02c6 z. (16) Given that the moment of inertia of a thin horizontal ring around the  z -axis, this becomes \u20d7 L 0  = q 2 ( m\u03c1 2 0 )  E 0 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c1 0 p 2 mE 0 \u02c6 z. (17) To calculate the torque exerted by the kinetic friction force, we need to integrate around the circum- ference of the ring. A given infinitesimal element of the ring has a mass  \u2206 m i , where the subscript denotes which differential element is being considered. Drawing a free body diagram for the differential element  i  shows that the only forces in the vertical direction are gravity  \u2206 m i g  and the normal force \u2206 N i . Since no part of the ring experiences a vertical acceleration, the vertical component of Newton\u2019s second law gives \u2206 N i  \u2212 \u2206 m i g  = 0 \u21d2 \u2206 N i  = \u2206 m i g. (18) In the tangential   \u02c6 \u03d5  direction, the differential element will experience a kinetic frictional force given by \u2206 \u20d7 F fi  =  \u2212 \u00b5 \u2206 N i   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u00b5 \u2206 m i g   \u02c6 \u03d5, (19) which points in the opposite direction to the rotation as to slow the object down. Note that   \u02c6 \u03d5  must point clockwise when viewed from above for the  ( \u03c1, \u03d5, z )  coordinate system to be right-handed. Since the differential element has a position vector of  \u20d7 r i  =  \u03c1 i \u02c6 \u03c1  =  \u03c1 0 \u02c6 \u03c1 , we can calculate the torque from this force to be \u2206 \u20d7 \u03c4 i  =  \u20d7 r i  \u00d7  \u2206 \u20d7 F fi  = ( \u03c1 0 \u02c6 \u03c1 )  \u00d7 \u0010 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2206 m i g   \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 =  \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5 \u2206 m i g \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5 \u2206 m i g \u02c6 z. (20) To find the overall torque on the ring  \u20d7 \u03c4 , we add up the contributions from every differential element, which, in the limit of  \u2206 m i  \u2192 0 , becomes the integral \u20d7 \u03c4  = lim \u2206 m i \u2192 0 X i \u2206 \u20d7 \u03c4 i  = lim \u2206 m i \u2192 0 X i ( \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5 \u2206 m i g \u02c6 z ) = Z ring ( \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5g \u02c6 z )  dm  =  \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5g \u0012Z ring dm \u0013 \u02c6 z. (21) 8 Angular momentum - 12 Given that the integral of  1  over the entire mass of the object is just the total mass  m , we find \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5g  ( m ) \u02c6 z. (22) We see that this torque is in the direction opposite to the ring\u2019s angular velocity as is intuitive. Since this torque is constant, integrating the formula  d \u20d7 L/dt  =  \u20d7 \u03c4  in time shows that \u20d7 L ( t ) =  \u20d7 \u03c4t  +   \u20d7 L 0 . (23) Plugging in equations (17) and (22) gives \u20d7 L ( t ) =  \u2212 \u03c1 0 \u00b5gmt \u02c6 z  +  \u03c1 0 p 2 mE 0 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c1 0 \u0010p 2 mE 0  \u2212 \u00b5gmt \u0011 \u02c6 z. (24) This can be used to calculate the time  t 2  at which the ring stops spinning according to \u20d7 L ( t 2 ) = 0 =  \u03c1 0 \u0010p 2 mE 0  \u2212 \u00b5gmt 2 \u0011 \u02c6 z \u21d2 t 2  = 1 \u00b5gm p 2 mE 0  =  1 \u00b5g r 2 E 0 m  . (25) Dividing this by equation (8) shows that the ratio  t 2 /t 1  = 1 . Alternative solution: Since friction does not depend on the surface area, we can consider the torque due to the friction of the ring as equivalent to the torque from a single point mass at the same radius \u20d7 \u03c4 f  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  = ( \u03c1 0 \u02c6 \u03c1 )  \u00d7 \u0010 \u2212 \u00b5N   \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 =  \u2212 \u00b5N\u03c1 0 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u00b5mg \u02c6 z, (26) where we have used  N  =  mg  from Newton\u2019s law in the vertical direction. We can then apply Newton\u2019s second law for rotational motion in the  \u02c6 z  direction and substitute equation (26) to find \u03a3 \u20d7 \u03c4  =  I\u20d7 \u03b1 \u21d2 \u20d7 \u03c4 f  =  m\u03c1 2 0 \u20d7 \u03b1 \u21d2 \u2212 \u00b5mg\u03c1 0  =  m\u03c1 2 0 \u03b1 \u21d2 \u03b1  =  \u2212 \u00b5g \u03c1 0 , (27) where  I  =  m\u03c1 2 0   is the moment of inertia of the ring around the  z  axis and the only net torque is from the friction force. Thus, the angular acceleration is constant in time. Integrating equation (27) in time gives \u03c9 ( t ) =  \u2212 \u00b5g \u03c1 0 t  +  \u03c9 0 , (28) where  \u03c9 0  is the initial angular velocity at  t  = 0 . Substituting equation (15) and  I  =  m\u03c1 2 0 , this can be used to find the time  t 2  at which the angular velocity becomes zero to be \u03c9 ( t 2 ) = 0 =  \u2212 \u00b5g \u03c1 0 t 2  + r 2 E 0 I =  \u2212 \u00b5g \u03c1 0 t 2  + s 2 E 0 m\u03c1 2 0 \u21d2 t 2  =  1 \u00b5g r 2 E 0 m  . (29) This is consistent with equation (25). 3.  The calculation of the time  t 1  stays the same because, for pure translation, the object is considered to be a point mass, so it doesn\u2019t matter if the object is a ring or a disk. To find  t 2 , we should first calculate the total torque arising from the frictional force. As in part 2, we can do this by integrating the force acting on all the differential elements that make up the object. The frictional force on a differential mass element is still given by equation (19). However, the torque must take into account that different mass elements can now be located at different radii  \u20d7 r i  =  \u03c1 i \u02c6 \u03c1 . Thus, the torque expressed by equation (20) becomes modified to be \u2206 \u20d7 \u03c4 i  =  \u20d7 r i  \u00d7  \u2206 \u20d7 F fi  = ( \u03c1 i \u02c6 \u03c1 )  \u00d7 \u0010 \u2212 \u00b5 \u2206 m i g   \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 =  \u2212 \u03c1 i \u00b5 \u2206 m i g \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u03c1 i \u00b5 \u2206 m i g \u02c6 z, (30) 9 Angular momentum - 12 where we must remember that we\u2019ve defined   \u02c6 \u03d5  to point clockwise and  \u02c6 z  to point down. To find the overall torque on the ring  \u20d7 \u03c4 , we add up the contributions from every differential element, which, in the limit of  \u2206 m i  \u2192 0 , becomes the integral \u20d7 \u03c4  = lim \u2206 m i \u2192 0 X i \u2206 \u20d7 \u03c4 i  = lim \u2206 m i \u2192 0 X i ( \u2212 \u03c1 i \u00b5 \u2206 m i g \u02c6 z ) = Z disk ( \u2212 \u03c1 i \u00b5g \u02c6 z )  dm. (31) Given that the disk is uniform, we can use the areal density to show \u03c3  =   m \u03c0\u03c1 2 0 =   dm dA \u21d2 dm  =   m \u03c0\u03c1 2 0 dA, (32) where  dA  is the differential element of area. In polar coordinates, it is expressed as  dA  =  \u03c1 i d\u03d5d\u03c1 i .

(35) We see that this torque is in the direction opposite to the ring\u2019s angular velocity as is intuitive. Since this torque is constant, integrating the formula  d \u20d7 L/dt  =  \u20d7 \u03c4  (i.e. the generalized version of Newton\u2019s second law for rotation) in time shows that \u20d7 L ( t ) =   \u20d7 L 0  +  \u20d7 \u03c4t. (36) To calculate  L 0  we can use equation (16) from part 2, but we must use the moment of inertia of a disk I  =  m\u03c1 2 0 / 2  (rather than a ring) to find \u20d7 L 0  = r 2 m\u03c1 2 0 2   E 0 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c1 0 p mE 0 \u02c6 z.

Since the satellite is not burning any fuel, the gravitational attraction to the planet must be causing the centripetal acceleration enabling the uniform circular motion. This condition is expressed through Newton\u2019s second law for the satellite as \u20d7 F G  =  m s \u20d7 a cent . (9) The centripetal acceleration is given by  \u20d7 a cent  =  \u2212 r 0 \u03c9 2 \u02c6 r  =  \u2212 r 0 ( v 0 /r 0 ) 2 \u02c6 r  =  \u2212 ( v 2 0 /r 0 )\u02c6 r , where  \u03c9  is the angular speed of the satellite.

(10) This solution can be checked by taking the circular case in our solution to part 1. If we let  r f  =  r c  =  r 0 , v f  =  v c  =  v 0 , and substitute equation (10), we find that both equations (7) and (8) are satisfied. Now let\u2019s compare  v 0  with  v c , given that  r 0  =  r c . Even though we have a solution for both, given by equations (7) and (10), this turns out to be surprisingly tricky. To make the comparison easier, we want to eliminate the velocity  v f  from equation (7). Thus, we rearrange equation (5) to find v f  =   r c r f v c .

We can solve part one in two ways: using Newton\u2019s second law or conservation of energy. Using Newton\u2019s second law:  At a given angular position, the gravitational force on the point mass is given by \u20d7 F g  =  mg \u02c6 x  =  mg \u0010 cos  \u03d5 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 sin  \u03d5 \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 , (1) where we have related the Cartesian and polar unit vectors using the formula  \u02c6 x  = cos  \u03d5 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 sin  \u03d5 \u02c6 \u03d5  from lecture 4a. We can calculate the tension from the radial component of Newton\u2019s second law using the centripetal acceleration  \u20d7 a cent  =  \u2212 ( v 2 \u03d5 /L )\u02c6 \u03c1  to get mg  cos  \u03d5  \u2212 T  =  ma cent  =  \u2212 m v 2 \u03d5 L \u21d2 T  =  mg  cos  \u03d5  +  m v 2 \u03d5 L  , (2) where  v \u03d5  is the speed of the point mass (which is purely tangential). However, this will not be needed for to solve the problem. Instead, the tangential component of Newton\u2019s second law is useful \u2212 mg  sin  \u03d5  =  ma \u03d5 \u21d2 \u2212 g  sin  \u03d5  =  a \u03d5 .

(4) 1 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 Since  \u03c1  =  L  is a constant, we have  \u02d9 \u03c1  = 0  and we can substitute the tangential component of equation (4) into equation (3) to find \u2212 g  sin  \u03d5  =  L d 2 \u03d5 dt 2 \u21d2 d 2 \u03d5 dt 2  +  g L   sin  \u03d5  = 0 .

(6) Using conservation of energy:  Since all of the forces acting on the pendulum are conservative, we can impose conservation of mechanical energy E m 0  =  E mf (7) between the initial state described in the problem (denoted by the subscript  0 ) and the final state when the pendulum is at any arbitrary angular position  \u03d5  (denoted by the subscript  f ). The only forces involved are gravity, so equation (7) is K 0  +  U g 0  =  K f  +  U gf . (8) The system is released from rest, so  K 0  = 0 . Additionally, we will define the reference point for the gravitational potential energy to be the origin  O  of our polar coordinate system (i.e. the location of the pivot point at the top of the string). Given the Cartesian coordinate system shown above, the gravitational potential energy of the point mass is given by U g  =  \u2212 mgx  =  \u2212 mg\u03c1  cos  \u03d5  =  \u2212 mgL  cos  \u03d5, (9) where we have expressed the Cartesian coordinate  x  in polar coordinates using the formula  x  =  \u03c1  cos  \u03d5 from lecture 4a. Substituting this,  K 0  = 0 , and the form of the rotational kinetic energy  K  = ( I/ 2) \u03c9 2 into equation (8) gives 0  \u2212 mgL  cos  \u03d5 0  =   I 2 \u03c9 2  \u2212 mgL  cos  \u03d5, (10) where  \u03c9  is the angular speed. For a point mass located a distance  \u03c1  =  L  away from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is  I  =  mL 2 . Employing this and taking the time derivative of equation (10) using the chain rule yields 0 =   mL 2 2 \u0012 2 \u03c9  d\u03c9 dt \u0013 +  mgL  sin  \u03d5 d\u03d5 dt \u21d2 0 =  L\u03c9  d\u03c9 dt   +  g  sin  \u03d5d\u03d5 dt  . (11) Identifying that  \u03c9  =  d\u03d5/dt  produces 0 =  L\u03c9  d 2 \u03d5 dt 2  +  g\u03c9  sin  \u03d5 \u21d2 d 2 \u03d5 dt 2  +  g L   sin  \u03d5  = 0 , (12) which is identical to equation (5). Thus, energy conservation gives the same answer as Newton\u2019s second law. 2. The differential equation for a simple harmonic oscillator has the form d 2 \u03d5 dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 \u03d5  = 0 , (13) where  \u03c9 0  is the angular frequency of oscillation. Thus, by comparison with equation (6), we see that \u03c9 0  = r  g L . (14) 2 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 To get the frequency  f 0  (i.e. the number of oscillations per second) from the angular frequency (i.e. the average number of radians the object completes in its oscillation per second), we use the fact that one oscillation corresponds to  2 \u03c0  radians. This means that  \u03c9 0  = 2 \u03c0f 0 , so f 0  =  1 2 \u03c0 r  g L . (15) 3. The period is the time it takes for the object to complete a full oscillation (i.e. the number of seconds per oscillation). This is simply the inverse of the number of oscillations per second (i.e. the frequency). Thus, using  T 0  = 1 /f 0  we find the period to be T 0  = 2 \u03c0 s L g  . (16) 4. The angular velocity of the point mass at a given location is easiest to calculate from conservation of energy. We can take equation (10) and let  \u03d5  = 0  to choose the final state to be when the pendulum is at the bottom of its swing \u2212 mgL  cos  \u03d5 0  =   I 2 \u03c9 2  \u2212 mgL. (17) Given that  I  =  mL 2 , we can rewrite this as \u2212 mgL  cos  \u03d5 0  =   mL 2 2 \u03c9 2   \u2212 mgL \u21d2 \u03c9  = r 2   g L   (1  \u2212 cos  \u03d5 0 ) . (18) The translational speed  v  =  v \u03d5  is purely tangential, which is related to the angular speed  \u03c9  through v \u03d5  =  \u03c1\u03c9. (19) Substituting equation (18) and the fact that  \u03c1  =  L  gives v \u03d5  =  L r 2   g L   (1  \u2212 cos  \u03d5 0 ) \u21d2 v \u03d5  = p 2 gL  (1  \u2212 cos  \u03d5 0 ) . (20) 5. No, these are not the same. The angular speed  \u03c9  =  d\u03d5/dt  is the rate of change in the angular position of the pendulum (where  2 \u03c0  radians corresponds to a  full circle  in our polar coordinate  \u03d5 ). The angular frequency  \u03c9 0  = p g/L  represents the average number of radians the object completes per second (where 2 \u03c0  radians corresponds to a  full oscillation ). Moreover, the angular speed  \u03c9  will change throughout the pendulum\u2019s motion, while the angular frequency  \u03c9 0  is defined such that it is always a constant. 6.

Note that here the subscript  r  indicate the right end of the bar, while the subscript  l  indicates the left.

(5) as  \u02c6 x \u00d7  \u02c6 x  = 0 . Writing out   \u20d7 F r  =  F rx \u02c6 x + F ry \u02c6 y  + F rz \u02c6 z  component-by-component in Cartesian coordinates allows us to reformulate the equation as \u02c6 x  \u00d7  ( F rx \u02c6 x  +  F ry \u02c6 y  +  F rz \u02c6 z ) = 0 \u21d2 F ry \u02c6 z  \u2212 F rz \u02c6 y  = 0 . (6) If we take the dot product of this equation with  \u02c6 z , we see that  F ry  = 0  and if we take the dot product of this equation with  \u02c6 y , we see that  F rz  = 0 . This implies that \u20d7 F r  =  F rx \u02c6 x  =  F r \u02c6 x (7) must be purely in the  \u02c6 x  direction. Through substitution into equation (4), we see that the same is true for \u20d7 F l  =  Ma \u02c6 x  \u2212 F r \u02c6 x  = ( Ma  \u2212 F r ) \u02c6 x  =  F l \u02c6 x.

(9) Thus, the additional forces from each hand must only have an  \u02c6 x  component and satisfy  F r  +  F l  =  Ma . 4 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 2. This problem is tricky because there are two different types of rotation. There is the rotation of the hoop about the axis, which has a constant magnitude  \u03c9 h  that starts out in the  \u02c6 x  direction at  t  = 0 . However, it changes direction because the bar is made to rotate about its center with a constant angular velocity  \u03c9 b \u02c6 z . The second type of rotation (i.e. the rotation of the bar in the  x - y  plane) causes the angular momentum to change. To quantify this second type of rotation, we will use the cylindrical coordinate system shown in the figure below (which shows the wheel from a top view relative to the figure in the problem statement). \u03c9 h \u03d5 \u03c9 h x z y \u03c1 z \u03d5 We can write the total angular momentum of the system (including both types of rotation) as \u20d7 L sys  =   \u20d7 L h  +   \u20d7 L b  =  I h \u03c9 h \u02c6 \u03c1  +  I b \u03c9 b \u02c6 z, (10) where  \u02c6 \u03c1  is changing with time and the subscripts  h  and  b  indicate the hoop and bar respectively. The hoop is thin and rotating about its center, so its moment of inertia is  I h  =  MR 2 . The bar is massless, but its rotation also rotates the hoop about its diameter. Thus, it has a moment of inertia of  I b  =  MR 2 / 2 , which we have found from a table noting that the hoop is thin (meaning it has zero width). Substituting these values into equation (10), we find \u20d7 L sys  =  MR 2 \u03c9 h \u02c6 \u03c1  +   M 2   R 2 \u03c9 b \u02c6 z. (11) A change in angular momentum is always caused by a net torque, which can be found from Newton\u2019s second law for rotation \u20d7 \u03c4 net  =   d\u20d7 L sys dt . (12) Substituting equation (11) gives \u20d7 \u03c4 net  =   d dt \u0012 MR 2 \u03c9 h \u02c6 \u03c1  +   M 2   R 2 \u03c9 b \u02c6 z \u0013 =  MR 2 \u03c9 h d \u02c6 \u03c1 dt  . (13) In lecture 4a, we calculated the derivatives of the cylindrical unit vectors, finding that  d \u02c6 \u03c1/dt  = ( d\u03d5/dt ) \u02c6 \u03d5 . Since the bar is changing angular position  \u03d5  at a constant angular speed  \u03c9 b  =  d\u03d5/dt , we can write d \u02c6 \u03c1/dt  =  \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5 . Substituting this into equation (13) produces \u20d7 \u03c4 net  =  MR 2 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5. (14) This torque must arise from the forces applied at the end of the bar by the demonstrator\u2019s hands. Thus, analogously to equation 2, we have \u20d7 \u03c4 net  =  \u20d7 \u03c4 r  +  \u20d7 \u03c4 l  =  \u20d7 r r  \u00d7   \u20d7 F r  +  \u20d7 r l  \u00d7   \u20d7 F l  =  \u2113 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7   \u20d7 F r  \u2212 \u2113 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7   \u20d7 F l  =  MR 2 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5 (15) \u21d2 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7 \u0010 \u20d7 F r  \u2212 \u20d7 F l \u0011 =   MR 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5, (16) 5 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 where we must take into account the rotation of the bar into our expression for the radial position of the demonstrator\u2019s hands by using  \u02c6 \u03c1  instead of  \u02c6 x . Additionally, we know that the center of the bar (i.e. the center of mass of the system) has no translational motion. Thus, by Newton\u2019s first law, the net force must be equal to \u20d7 F net  =   \u20d7 F r  +   \u20d7 F l  = 0 \u21d2 \u20d7 F l  =  \u2212 \u20d7 F r . (17) Substituting this into equation (16) gives \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7 \u0010 \u20d7 F r  +   \u20d7 F r \u0011 =   MR 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5 \u21d2 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7   \u20d7 F r  =   MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5. (18) Writing out   \u20d7 F r  =  F r\u03c1 \u02c6 \u03c1  +  F r\u03d5   \u02c6 \u03d5  +  F rz \u02c6 z  component-by-component in cylindrical coordinates shows that \u02c6 \u03c1  \u00d7 \u0010 F r\u03c1 \u02c6 \u03c1  +  F r\u03d5   \u02c6 \u03d5  +  F rz \u02c6 z \u0011 =   MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5 \u21d2 F r\u03d5 \u02c6 z  \u2212 F rz   \u02c6 \u03d5  =   MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b   \u02c6 \u03d5. (19) Looking at each component of this equation, we see that we must have  F r\u03d5  = 0  and \u2212 F rz  =   MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b \u21d2 F rz  =  \u2212 MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b . (20) Plugging this into equation (17) shows that  F l\u03d5  = 0  and F lz  =   MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b . (21) Thus, our final answer is \u20d7 F r  =  F \u03c1r  \u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b \u02c6 z (22) \u20d7 F l  =  \u2212 F \u03c1r  \u02c6 \u03c1  +   MR 2 2 \u2113 \u03c9 h \u03c9 b \u02c6 z. (23) We see that the radial component of the force in unconstrained as long as it is equal and opposite according to equation (17). This is intuitive as the tension in the bar will transmit the force along the bar, while not affecting its motion. Less intuitive is the fact that, to get the bar to rotate in the   \u02c6 \u03d5 direction, you must apply forces in the  \u02c6 z  direction. This is the nature of a gyroscope \u2014 applying a force creates motion in a perpendicular direction. ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "We aim to model the trajectory of a car driving along a bumpy road in the following way. A point mass of mass  m  (representing the body of the car) moves forwards with a constant horizontal velocity  v x . The mass is connected to a spring with spring constant  k  and equilibrium length  \u2113 0  (representing the shocks of the car). At the end of the spring, there is a massless wheel (representing a wheel of the car) with a negligibly small radius relative to the the other distances in the problem. The road has the shape of a cosine with bumps of height  H  and length  L  and at time  t  = 0  the wheel drops into the first bump (as shown below). Assume that the mass, spring, and wheel remain perfectly upright throughout the entire process. m k v x H L 1. Express the vertical position of the wheel as a function of time. 2. Using this information, deduce the equation of motion in the vertical direction for the body of the car. 3. Solve this equation to find the amplitude of vertical oscillations of the body of the car that are caused by the bumps. Under which conditions would your ride be the  least  comfortable? ", "answer": "We choose to use a Cartesian coordinate system with  \u02c6 x  in the direction of travel of the car and  \u02c6 y  pointing upwards. 1. We are told that the road has a cosine height profile given by y r ( x ) =  C 1  cos ( C 2 x )  , (1) where  C 1  and  C 2  are unknown constants that we must determine from the geometry of the road. Note that, by taking the form of equation (1), we are implicitly choosing the  y  location of the origin to be halfway between the top and bottom of the bumps.  C 1  quantifies the height of the bumps. Since the maximum and minimum of the cosine function are  1  and  \u2212 1  respectively, the total change in elevation 6 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 of equation (1) is  2 C 1 . Since the physical change in elevation (from trough to peak) is  H , we have H  = 2 C 1 , which implies that C 1  =   H 2   . (2) Next, we see that  C 2  quantifies the length of the bump. From the problem statement, we know that, if you are at the peak of a bump, you will arrive at the next peak by traveling a horizontal distance  L . Similarly, if you are at a maximum of the cosine function, you will find the next maximum by increasing the argument of the cosine function by  2 \u03c0  (as the cosine function is  2 \u03c0  periodic). We must choose  C 2 such that these two periodic behaviors correspond to one another. Thus, if  x  =  L  the argument of the cosine function should be  2 \u03c0 . Looking at equation (1), this means that  2 \u03c0  =  C 2 L  and we find C 2  =  2 \u03c0 L  . (3) Substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) gives the shape of the road in terms of known parameters y r ( x ) =   H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  x \u0013 . (4) The wheel has a negligibly small radius, so its trajectory is the same as the road\u2019s y w ( x ) =  y r ( x ) =   H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  x \u0013 . (5) We know that the body of the car moves forwards with a constant horizontal velocity of  v x , so the wheel must as well (otherwise the car would be torn apart). Since the velocity is constant we know that the horizontal position of the wheel is just x ( t ) =  v x t  +  x 0  =  v x t, (6) where we have taken the  x  loction of the origin to be the location of the wheel at  t  = 0  so that  x 0  = 0 . This allows us to replace the  x  coordinate in equation (5) to find the vertical position of the wheel as a function of time y w ( t ) =   H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  v x t \u0013 . (7) 2. The equation of motion for the car comes from Newton\u2019s second law \u20d7 F net  =   \u20d7 F g  +   \u20d7 F s  =  m\u20d7 a c , (8) where \u20d7 F g  =  \u2212 mg \u02c6 y (9) is the gravitational force, \u20d7 F s  =  \u2212 k \u2206 y \u02c6 y (10) is the spring force, and the  c  subscript indicates it refers to the body of the car. The challenge is to determine  \u2206 y , the extension of the spring relative to its equilibrium length. First, we will let  y c  denote the height of the car, which is a function of time. From the picture in the problem statement, we see that, at any instant, the length of the spring will be  \u2113 =  y c  \u2212 y w . Given that the equilibrium length is \u2113 0 , we have that \u2206 y  =  \u2113 \u2212 \u2113 0  =  y c  \u2212 y w  \u2212 \u2113 0 . (11) Substituting equations (9), (10), and (11) into the  \u02c6 y  component of equation (8) gives \u2212 mg  \u2212 k \u2206 y  =  ma c \u21d2 \u2212 mg  \u2212 k  ( y c  \u2212 y w  \u2212 \u2113 0 ) =  m d 2 y c dt 2  . (12) 7 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 Substituting equation (7) from part 1 yields \u2212 mg  \u2212 k \u0012 y c  \u2212 H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  v x t \u0013 \u2212 \u2113 0 \u0013 =  m d 2 y c dt 2  . (13) Rearranging we can isolate the inhomogeneous terms on the right side and arrive at the equation of motion d 2 y c dt 2  +  k m y c  =  k m H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  v x t \u0013 +   k m \u2113 0  \u2212 g. (14) 3. Equation (14) is a complicated differential equation, but we can recognize it as the simple harmonic oscillator equation with the addition of forcing terms (i.e. all the terms on the right side of the equation). To attack this, we first let \u03c9 0  = r k m (15) \u03c9 d  =  2 \u03c0v x L (16) to get the simpler and more familiar form of d 2 y c dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 H 2  cos ( \u03c9 d t ) +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g. (17) You can solve this equation by looking it up in the Math Review document on the course Moodle. However, here we will show how to solve it directly. This differential equation is similar to an equation we solved in lecture 13a, but there are extra constant terms. Because these terms are constant, we can eliminate them by defining a new vertical coordinate  Y c  such that \u03c9 2 0 Y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 y c   \u2212 \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   +  g \u21d2 \u03c9 2 0 y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 Y c   +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g. (18) Taking two derivatives of this equation yields \u03c9 2 0 d 2 y c dt 2  =  \u03c9 2 0 d 2 Y c dt 2 \u21d2 d 2 y c dt 2  =  d 2 Y c dt 2  . (19) Substituting equations (18) and (19) into equation (17) gives d 2 Y c dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 Y c   +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g  =  \u03c9 2 0 H 2  cos ( \u03c9 d t ) +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g \u21d2 d 2 Y c dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 Y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 H 2  cos ( \u03c9 d t )  , (20) where we see that the two offending terms have been eliminated. This is now identical to the differential equation solved in lecture 13a, so long as we identify that the notation in class corresponds to  x  =  Y c , \u03bb  = 0 , and  F d /m  =  \u03c9 2 0 H/ 2 . Thus, the solution is Y c  ( t ) =  A 1 e i\u03c9 0 t   +  A 2 e \u2212 i\u03c9 0 t   +   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d cos ( \u03c9 d t )  . (21) We can find the solution for the original vertical coordinate by substituting equations (15) and (21) into equation (18) to get \u03c9 2 0 y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 \u0012 A 1 e i\u03c9 0 t   +  A 2 e \u2212 i\u03c9 0 t   +   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d cos ( \u03c9 d t ) \u0013 +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g \u21d2 y c  ( t ) =  A 1 e i\u03c9 0 t   +  A 2 e \u2212 i\u03c9 0 t   +   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d cos ( \u03c9 d t ) +  \u2113 0  \u2212 mg k  , (22) 8 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 where  A 1  and  A 2  are integration constants that are determined by the initial conditions. This is the full solution to the differential equation of equation (14). Note that the first two terms correspond to oscillation, which can be seen through applying Euler\u2019s formula  exp( ix ) = cos( x ) +  i  sin( x )  . However, this oscillation occurs at the natural angular frequency  \u03c9 0  of the system and is independent of the characteristics of the bumps. This oscillation would occur on flat ground, if the body of the car was displaced a bit vertically. The problem statement asks us about the oscillations caused by the bumps. These are represented by the third term, which we see depends on the height of the bumps as well as their length (through equation (16)). Studying this term, we can see that the amplitude of the vertical oscillations caused by the bumps is \u2206 y c  =   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d . (23) Thus, the ride would be least comfortable when  \u03c9 2 d   =  \u03c9 2 0   because the amplitude of the vertical oscillation would become infinite, which represents resonance. This condition is equivalent to \u03c9 2 0   =  \u03c9 2 d \u21d2 k m   = \u0012 2 \u03c0v x L \u0013 2 \u21d2 v x  =   L 2 \u03c0 r k m (24) and satisfying it for an extended period of time might cause damage to the car.

It is pulled at its axis by an inextensible wire, which passes around a pulley and connects to a suspended block (see figure) with the same mass  m . The wire and pulley have negligible masses and the wire always remains tight. The system is initially at rest. 1. What is the speed of the center of mass of the wheel after it has moved forwards by a distance  d ? 2. Since the wheel does not slip, what can we say about the value of the static friction coefficient  \u00b5 s between the wheel and the table? m m R 1 Rotation, translation, and rolling", "answer": "y b x w T T mg mg F f N x y z 1. Consider the system composed of the wheel and the block (i.e. the two objects in the problem that move and have mass). Since we are asked about the state of the system at a particular  position  (i.e. after the center of the wheel has traveled a distance  d ), it is best to use conservation of energy. If we were asked about the system after a given amount of time  t , it would be easiest to use Newton\u2019s laws. The forces on the wheel are gravity   \u20d7 F gw  =  mg \u02c6 y , the normal force from the table   \u20d7 N  =  \u2212 N  \u02c6 y , and the tension from the wire   \u20d7 T  =  T  \u02c6 x . Additionally, we can infer that there must be a static friction force F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s N  in the  \u2212 \u02c6 x  direction, in order for the wheel to roll without slipping. The forces on the block are gravity   \u20d7 F gb  =  mg \u02c6 y  and the tension force from the wire   \u20d7 T  =  \u2212 T  \u02c6 y . The tension in the wire at the block must be equal in magnitude to the tension at the wheel as both the rope and pulley are massless. Since tension is an internal force that does not dissipate any energy, the only nonconservative forces that could be doing work on the system are the normal force   \u20d7 N  and the friction force   \u20d7 F f . However, since the wheel is rolling without slipping, both forces are not being applied over a distance, just at a changing but always stationary point. This is analogous to a box sitting on a table. You can push the box slightly and static friction will keep it at rest by opposing the applied force. In this case, friction does no work as the box is stationary the entire time, so the force is applied over zero distance. Another way to see this is by considering the power  P  =   \u20d7 F  \u00b7  \u20d7 v . Since the velocity of the point of the wheel in contact with the ground is  \u20d7 v  = 0 , the power is clearly  P  = 0 . Since the power  P  =  dW/dt is also the time derivative of the work  W , the work must be a constant value throughout the motion of the block. Since the amount of work done by the friction and normal forces on the wheel is zero initially (as the system has yet to start to move), this means they never do any work. Thus mechanical energy is conserved throughout the motion of the system. 1 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 The total mechanical energy of the system is given by E m  =  K rot w +  K trans w +  K trans b +  U gb \u21d2 E m  =   I w 2   \u03c9 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b (1) \u21d2 E m  =   m 4   R 2 \u03c9 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b , (2) where  K rot w is the rotational kinetic energy of the wheel,  K trans w is the translational kinetic energy of the wheel,  K trans b is the translational kinetic energy of the falling block,  U gb  is the gravitational potential energy of the block, I w  =   m 2   R 2 (3) is the moment of inertia of the uniform solid wheel rotating about its center,  \u03c9 w  is the angular speed of the wheel,  v w  is the speed of the center of mass of the wheel,  v b  is the speed of the block, and we have defined a Cartesian coordinate system as shown in the figure above. Using the no-slip condition, we know that the speed of the center of the wheel is v w  =  R\u03c9 w \u21d2 \u03c9 w  =   v w R  . (4) Substituting this into equation (2) gives E m  =   m 4   R 2  \u0010 v w R \u0011 2 +   m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b \u21d2 E m  =  3 4 mv 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b . (5) Since the wire is inextensible and we have carefully defined our coordinate system such that  x w  = 0 and  y b  = 0  initially, we can see the constraint condition is  y b  =  x w . Taking a derivative in time gives v b  =  v w . (6) Substituting these two relations into equation (5) gives E m  =  3 4 mv 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   \u2212 mgx w   = 5 4 mv 2 w   \u2212 mgx w . (7) Now we can apply conservation of mechanical energy between the initial state (when everything is at rest) and the final state (when the center of the wheel has moved by a distance  x w  =  d ) to find 0  \u2212 0 =  5 4 mv 2 w   \u2212 mgd, (8) where we have take the reference point for the gravitational potential energy of each object to be their initial location. Solving for the final velocity of the center of the wheel gives v w  = r 4 5 gd. (9) 2. For the wheel not to slip, the static friction force must not exceed its maximum magnitude of F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s N. (10) Drawing a free body diagram for the wheel and looking at Newton\u2019s second law in the vertical direction shows that the normal force has a magnitude of  N  =  mg . Thus, we find F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s mg. (11) 2 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 By rearranging we find that the coefficient of static friction must be sufficiently high to satisfy \u00b5 s  \u2265 F f mg  , (12) otherwise the wheel will slip. In order to determine  F f , we must analyze the entire system. We can apply Newton\u2019s second law to the wheel to get the equation X F wx  =  ma w \u21d2 T  \u2212 F f  =  m dv w dt \u21d2 T  =  F f  +  m dv w dt (13) in the horizontal direction, where  a w  is the acceleration of the center of the wheel. Applying Newton\u2019s second law to the falling block and substituting equation (13) gives X F by  =  ma b \u21d2 mg  \u2212 T  =  m dv b dt \u21d2 mg  \u2212 F f  \u2212 m dv w dt   =  mdv b dt  . (14) From the constraint condition of equation (6), we find mg  \u2212 F f  \u2212 m dv w dt   =  mdv w dt \u21d2 mg  \u2212 F f  = 2 m dv w dt \u21d2 dv w dt   =  g 2   \u2212 F f 2 m . (15) Lastly, applying Newton\u2019s second law for the rotational motion of the wheel about its center gives X \u20d7 \u03c4 w  =  I w \u20d7 \u03b1 w \u21d2 R \u02c6 y  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  =  I w d\u03c9 w dt   \u02c6 z \u21d2 R \u02c6 y  \u00d7  ( \u2212 F f  \u02c6 x ) =  I w d\u03c9 w dt \u21d2 F f  =   I w R d\u03c9 w dt (16) in the  \u02c6 z  direction, where  \u20d7 \u03b1 w  is the angular acceleration of the wheel (which is the derivative of the angular velocity  \u20d7 \u03c9 w ). There are no other torques on the wheel because tension and gravity act at the pivot point and the normal force is anti-parallel to the position vector to its point of application (i.e. the cross product in the torque evaluates to zero). Substituting equations (3), (4), and (15) into equation (16) gives F f  =  1 R \u0010 m 2   R 2 \u0011 \u0012  1 R dv w dt \u0013 =   m 2 \u0012 g 2   \u2212 F f 2 m \u0013 =  1 4 mg  \u2212 1 4 F f , (17) which can be rearranged to show F f  =  1 5 mg. (18) Substituting this into equation (12) reveals the condition on the static coefficient of friction to be \u00b5 s  \u2265 1 5  = 0 . 2 . (19) This is quite a fundamental solution as we see that it is independent of the mass  m  and radius  R . The main requirement for it to be applicable is that the wheel and block must have the same mass. 3 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "A donkey starts pulling the cart shown below with a constant horizontal force of  F d  = 180  N.

F d Side view F d Top view M m ", "answer": "F d N a mg F f N a mg N g F f x y z N a N g 1. Due to the symmetry of the system, the free body diagram for all of the wheels is identical and is shown above. There are four forces on each wheel: gravity acting at the center of mass of the wheel (i.e. the center of the wheel), the normal force from the axle of the cart, the normal force from the ground, and the static friction force from the ground. 2. To approach this problem, it is best to first think about which objects are moving together and the different types of motion that are occurring. Since the wheels and the body of the cart are attached via the axles, the translational motion of the centers of the wheels and the cart must be identical. Thus, we can consider the cart-wheels system as a whole and write Newton\u2019s second law in the horizontal direction as X  \u20d7 F  = ( M  + 4 m ) \u20d7 a \u21d2 F d  \u2212 4 F f  = ( M  + 4 m )  a, (1) where  a  is the acceleration of the cart as well as the centers of the wheels. Note that all other forces are internal forces within the cart-wheels system, so they cancel due to Newton\u2019s third law. However, there is one other type of motion, which is the rotation of the wheels. Enforcing the no- slip condition will allow us to relate the frictional force causing the rotation of the wheels with the translational motion of the whole cart. We start by writing Newton\u2019s second law for the rotation of a single wheel in the  \u02c6 z  direction as X \u20d7 \u03c4  =  I w \u20d7 \u03b1 \u21d2 \u20d7 R f  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  =   m 8   d 2 \u20d7 \u03b1 \u21d2 \u0012 \u2212 d 2  \u02c6 y \u0013 \u00d7 ( \u2212 F f  \u02c6 x ) =  \u2212 m 8   d 2  d\u03c9 dt   \u02c6 z \u21d2 F f  =   m 4   dd\u03c9 dt  ,  (2) where  I w  =  m ( d/ 2) 2 / 2 =  md 2 / 8  is the moment of inertia of the wheel about its axle,  \u20d7 \u03b1  is the angular acceleration of the wheel,   \u20d7 R f  is the position vector from the axle to the point of application of the friction force, and  \u03c9  is the angular velocity of the wheel in the  \u02c6 z  direction. The condition for rolling without slipping is given by \u03c9  = v d/ 2 , (3) where  v  is the translational velocity of the center of the wheel (as well as the cart as a whole). Substituting this into equation (2) gives F f  =   m 4   d \u0012 2 d dv dt \u0013 =   m 2   a. (4) Substituting this into equation (1) allows us to find F d  \u2212 4 \u0010 m 2   a \u0011 = ( M  + 4 m )  a \u21d2 F d  = ( M  + 6 m )  a \u21d2 a  = F d M  + 6 m . (5) 4 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 Since the acceleration is constant, it is straightforward to integrate this to find that the velocity is v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0  =  at  = F d M  + 6 m t, (6) where the problem statement tells us that the initial velocity is  v 0  = 0 . Plugging in the numerical values into equations (5) and (6) gives  a  = 0 . 94  m/s 2   and  v  = 2 . 8  m/s after  t  = 3  seconds respectively. 3. To calculate the required coefficient of static friction to enable rolling without slipping, we first must calculate the magnitude of the static friction force. This can be found by substituting equation (5) into equation (4) to see F f  =   m 2 F d M  + 6 m . (7) We then require that this force be less than the maximum possible static friction force F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s N g \u21d2 m 2 F d M  + 6 m   \u2264 \u00b5 s N g \u21d2 \u00b5 s  \u2265 m 2 1 N g F d M  + 6 m . (8) The normal force can be found through the vertical component of Newton\u2019s second law on the entire cart-wheels system according to X  \u20d7 F  = ( M  + 4 m ) \u20d7 a \u21d2 4 N g  \u2212 F g  = 0 \u21d2 4 N g  \u2212 ( M  + 4 m )  g  = 0 \u21d2 N g  =  1 4  ( M  + 4 m )  g  (9) as the acceleration in the  \u02c6 y  direction is zero.

We will choose to use a one-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system with the origin defined to be the location of the ceiling. If the spider were located at  x  = 0 , the spring would have a length of zero. 5 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 Thus, the equilibrium position  of the spring  is at  x  =  L , but this is different than the equilibrium position  of the spider  (due to the presence of the gravitational force). We show a free body diagram above, but note that the spring force can point either up or down depending on the location of the spider. The equilibrium position of the spider  x eq  is where the sum of the forces are equal to zero (i.e. the acceleration is  a  = 0 ). This is the definition of \u201cequilibrium.\u201d Using Newton\u2019s second law and the form of the spring force F s  =  k  ( x  \u2212 L )  , (1) we find mg  \u2212 F s  = 0 \u21d2 mg  \u2212 k  ( x eq  \u2212 L ) = 0 \u21d2 x eq  =  L  +   m k  g, (2) where we know that for equilibrium the spring force must be pointing up to counteract gravity. 2. The equation of motion is also found from Newton\u2019s second law, but allowing the spider to be at other positions than the equilibrium position (such that the acceleration  a  is not necessarily zero). At any arbitrary  x  location, Newton\u2019s second law is mg  \u2212 F s  =  ma \u21d2 mg  \u2212 k  ( x  \u2212 L ) =  m d 2 x dt 2 \u21d2 d 2 x dt 2  +  k m x  =  k m L  +  g.

Substituting equations (4) and (6) into equation (3), we find \u2212 A\u03c9 2 0   cos ( \u03c9 0 t  +  \u03c6 ) +  k m   ( A  cos ( \u03c9 0 t  +  \u03c6 ) +  x ) =  k m L  +  g (7) \u21d2 \u0012  k m   \u2212 \u03c9 2 0 \u0013 A  cos ( \u03c9 0 t  +  \u03c6 ) =   k m L  +  g  \u2212 k m x. (8) To solve this equation, we note that the time  t  is an independent parameter and equation (8) must be satisfied for all values of  t . This means that we can separate the equation based on terms with different functional dependences on time (i.e. the terms proportional to  cos ( \u03c9 0 t  +  \u03c6 )  and those constant with t ) and require them to zero independently (e.g. equations (9) and (11) below). Equivalently, we can simply evaluate equation (8) at  t  = ( \u03c0/ 2  \u2212 \u03c6 ) /\u03c9 0  to find \u0012  k m   \u2212 \u03c9 2 0 \u0013 A  cos \u0012 \u03c9 0 \u0012 \u03c0/ 2  \u2212 \u03c6 \u03c9 0 \u0013 +  \u03c6 \u0013 =   k m L  +  g  \u2212 k m x \u21d2 0 =   k m L  +  g  \u2212 k m x (9) \u21d2 x  =  L  +   m k  g, (10) where we note from equation (2) that  x  =  x eq .

(12) 6 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 4. The problem states that at time  t 0  the velocity of the spider is  v ( t 0 ) = 0  and the spring does not exert a force on the spider. We can use equation (5) to see that the first condition is equivalent to v ( t 0 ) = 0 =  \u2212 A\u03c9 0  sin ( \u03c9 0 t 0  +  \u03c6 ) \u21d2 0 = sin ( \u03c9 0 t 0  +  \u03c6 )  . (13) The sine function evaluates to zero when its argument equals  n\u03c0  for some integer  n  \u2208 Z . We are free to arbitrarily choose any integer value of  n  as they all satisfy the equation. This implies that \u03c9 0 t 0  +  \u03c6  =  n\u03c0 \u21d2 \u03c6  =  n\u03c0  \u2212 \u03c9 0 t 0 . (14) Using equations (1) and (4), we see that the second condition corresponds to F s  ( t 0 ) = 0 =  k  ( x  ( t 0 )  \u2212 L ) \u21d2 x  ( t 0 ) =  L \u21d2 A  cos ( \u03c9 0 t 0  +  \u03c6 ) +  x  =  L. (15) The condition  x  ( t 0 ) =  L  makes sense. It is saying that, if the force exerted by the spring is zero at t  =  t 0 , the spider must be starting at the equilibrium position  of the spring  L . Substituting equations (10) and (14) gives A  cos ( \u03c9 0 t 0  + ( n\u03c0  \u2212 \u03c9 0 t 0 )) + \u0010 L  +   m k  g \u0011 =  L \u21d2 A  cos ( n\u03c0 ) =  \u2212 m k  g (16) \u21d2 A  ( \u2212 1) n   =  \u2212 m k  g \u21d2 A  =  \u2212 ( \u2212 1) n  m k  g \u21d2 A  =  \u00b1 m k  g. (17) This indicates that there are two possible solutions: the plus sign (corresponding to odd values of  n ) or the minus sign (corresponding to even values of  n ). However, we can show that these two solutions are physically identical. If we take the solution with the positive sign (i.e. choosing any odd value of n ) and substitute it into equation (4) along with equation (14), we can determine the position to be x ( t ) = \u0010 m k  g \u0011 cos ( \u03c9 0 t  + ( n\u03c0  \u2212 \u03c9 0 t 0 )) +  x  =   m k  g  cos ( \u03c9 0  ( t  \u2212 t 0 ) +  n\u03c0 ) +  x. (18) In the same way, we can determine the position corresponding to the solution with the negative sign (i.e. choosing any even value of  n ) to be x ( t ) = \u0010 \u2212 m k  g \u0011 cos ( \u03c9 0 t  + ( n\u03c0  \u2212 \u03c9 0 t 0 )) +  x  =  \u2212 m k  g  cos ( \u03c9 0  ( t  \u2212 t 0 ) +  n\u03c0 ) +  x (19) =   m k  g  cos ( \u03c9 0  ( t  \u2212 t 0 ) +  n\u03c0  +  \u03c0 ) +  x  =  m k  g  cos ( \u03c9 0  ( t  \u2212 t 0 ) + ( n  + 1)  \u03c0 ) +  x (20) using a trigonometric identity to remove the negative sign out in front. The only difference between equation (18) and equation (20) is the choice of  n , which is arbitrary. Thus, without loss of generality, we can take  n  = 1  meaning that equations (14) and (17) become \u03c6  =  \u03c0  \u2212 \u03c9 0 t 0 (21) A  =   m k  g. (22) 5.

Here  x t is the position of the tortoise,  x h  is the position of the hare, and it is helpful to define the following times: \u2022  t 0  = 0  (the time at which the race starts), \u2022  t 1  (the time at which the tortoise reaches the bridge, which is when the hare starts to accelerate), and \u2022  t 2  (the arrival time of the tortoise and hare). To sketch the plot, we first consider the tortoise. It has a constant velocity throughout the entire race. A constant velocity corresponds to a position that is linear with time, so we can draw a straight line between the points  ( t  =  t 0 , x  = 0)  and  ( t  =  t 2 , x  =  L ) . The trajectory of the hare is a bit more complicated. The hare starts at a constant velocity that is slower than that of the tortoise and maintains the constant velocity until  t  =  t 1 .

We integrate once in time to find the velocity \u02d9 x  =  at  +  C, where  C  is an integration constant. To solve for  C , we evaluate this equation at  t  = 0  and find \u02d9 x  = 0 +  C  =  C. Thus, the constant  C  is equal to the velocity at  t  = 0 , which we represent as  v 0  =  C . This shows that the velocity is given by \u02d9 x  =  v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0 .

In figure 4, we use these values to plot the acceleration as a function of time. 6 Figure 4: The acceleration of the train (in m/s 2 ) as a function of time (in s). Given that we know the acceleration, it is natural to calculate the velocity next. We will denote the velocity throughout each of the time intervals by  v i ( t ) , where the subscript  i  equals  1 ,  2 , or  3  and refers to the first, second, or third time interval respectively. Similarly, we will denote the initial velocity of the  i th   time interval to be  v 0 ,i . During all time intervals the acceleration is constant, so we can apply equations (1) and (2) from problem 4. Equation (1) becomes v i ( t ) =  a i t  +  v 0 ,i , (6) where  a i  is the acceleration during the time interval that we have calculated above. Importantly, using the form of equation (1) requires that we define the start of each time interval to be  t  = 0 . This means that we are defining a separate time coordinate system for each time interval. Keeping track and correctly handling these different time coordinates is one of the most challenging parts of the problem. It is possible to calculate everything on a single time coordinate, but the mathematics become more complicated. Since the train started with  v 0 , 1  = 0 , during the first time interval equation (6) is v 1 ( t ) =  a 1 t  = \u0012 1 3 m s 2 \u0013 t. Therefore, at the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is traveling at  v 1 (60  s ) = 20  m / s  =  v 0 , 2 . Substituting this initial velocity and  a 2  = 0  into equation (6), we see that the velocity during the second interval is a constant value of v 2 ( t ) =  v 0 , 2  = 20   m s   . Thus, the initial condition for the third time interval is  v 2 (300  s ) = 20  m / s  =  v 0 , 3 , so v 3 ( t ) =  a 3 t  +  v 0 , 3  = \u0012 \u2212 1 6 m s 2 \u0013 t  + 20   m s   . To produce the plot for velocity we need to combine these three results. However, we must remember to account for the different time coordinate systems by shifting the second time interval by 60 s and the third time interval by 300 s + 60 s = 360 s. This gives figure 5. Lastly, we can calculate the positions analogously to the velocities, using equation (2) instead of equation (1). We see that the position during each time interval changes quadratically as a function of time according to x i ( t ) =  1 2 a i t 2  +  v 0 ,i t  +  x 0 ,i , (7) 7 Figure 5: The velocity of the train (in m/s) as a function of time (in s). where  x 0 ,i  is the initial position of the train during the  i th   time interval. Again, we are defining a separate time coordinate for each time interval such that the start of every time interval is  t  = 0 . We will take x  =  x 0 , 1  = 0  to be the initial location of the train at the start of the first time interval. We showed above that  v 0 , 1  = 0 , so during the first time interval equation (7) becomes x 1  =  1 2 \u0012 1 3 m s 2 \u0013 t 2   = \u0012 1 6 m s 2 \u0013 t 2 . At the interface between time intervals 1 and 2, the train is located at  x 1 (60  s ) = 600  m  =  x 0 , 2 . Given that we found  v 0 , 2  = 20  m / s above, the position throughout the second time interval is x 2  = \u0010 20   m s \u0011 t  + 600  m . At the interface between time intervals 2 and 3, the train is located at  x 2 (300  s ) = 6600  m  =  x 0 , 3 . Given that  v 0 , 3  = 20  m / s from above, the position throughout the third time interval is x 3  =  1 2 \u0012 \u2212 1 6 m s 2 \u0013 t 2   + \u0010 20   m s \u0011 t  + 6600  m .

At what position does the collision occur? 4. What is the minimum speed  v 0  required to ensure the stone and the cheese collide? ", "answer": "Crow Fox O x y v 0 \u03b1 L H g 1,2. We start by taking the diagram provided with the question and defining the angle  \u03b1  as well as a convenient coordinate system. The origin  O  is the position of the fox, the angle  \u03b1  defines the direction of the initial velocity of the stone relative to the  x  axis, the  y  axis is defined to be anti-parallel to  \u20d7 g , and the  x  axis is defined to be in the direction of the initial horizontal velocity of the stone. Both objects experience projectile motion, so we can directly write their equations of motion. For the stone we have x s   ( t ) =  v s x 0 t  +  x s 0 and y s   ( t ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2  +  v s 0 y t  +  y s 0 . Similarly, for the cheese we have x c   ( t ) =  v c x 0 t  +  x c 0 and y c   ( t ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2  +  v c 0 y t  +  y c 0 . The initial conditions of the stone are  x s 0   = 0 ,  y s 0   = 0 ,  v s x 0   =  v 0   cos  \u03b1 , and  v s y 0   =  v 0   sin  \u03b1 , while the initial conditions of the cheese are  x c 0   =  L ,  y c 0   =  H ,  v c x 0   = 0 , and  v c y 0   = 0 . Substituting these values gives x s   ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  \u03b1 (1) y s   ( t ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2  +  v 0 t  sin  \u03b1 (2) 1  for the stone and x c   ( t ) =  L (3) y c   ( t ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2  +  H. (4) for the cheese. For the stone and cheese to collide, there must be a single time  t  =  t coll  for which they are at the exact same position. We can write this condition as x s   ( t coll ) =  x c   ( t coll ) (5) and y s   ( t coll ) =  y c   ( t coll )  . (6) Substituting the equations of motion for the stone and cheese from above, equation (5) becomes v 0 t coll  cos  \u03b1  =  L, which implies that t coll  = L v 0  cos  \u03b1 . Using basic trigonometry and the Pythagorean theorem, the figure above shows that  cos  \u03b1  =  L/ \u221a L 2   +  H 2 . Substituting this gives t coll  = \u221a L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . (7) In the  y  direction we use equation (6), which is \u2212 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  v 0 t coll   sin  \u03b1  =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  H. Crucially, we see that the gravitational acceleration terms on both sides cancel and gravity disappears from the problem, leaving v 0 t coll  sin  \u03b1  =  H. Solving for the time and using trigonometry to show  sin  \u03b1  =  H/ \u221a L 2   +  H 2 , we find that t coll  = H v 0  sin  \u03b1   = \u221a L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . (8) We see that the collision times we calculated in equations (7) and (8) are identical. This means we really do have a collision \u2013 the stone and cheese are at the same  x  and  y  location at the same time. This occurs at time t coll  = \u221a L 2   +  H 2 v 0 . Note that the fact that there is a collision does not depend on the value of  v 0  nor  g ! 3. The position of the collision can be found by substituting the collision time  t coll  back into the equations of motion. Using equation (1) or (3), the  x  position is simply x s   ( t coll ) =  x c   ( t coll ) =  L. (9) Using equation (2) or (4) and a bit of algebra, we find that the  y  location of the collision is y s   ( t coll ) =  y c   ( t coll ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2 coll   +  H  =  \u2212 g 2 L 2   +  H 2 v 2 0 +  H. (10) 2  4. Above, we have shown that the stone and cheese always collide, without posing any restriction on the initial speed of the stone. However, in reality there is a restriction to impose \u2013 if the initial speed is not large enough, the stone will hit the ground before it hits the cheese. This does not contradict the above derivation \u2013 for low initial speeds the above derivation simply predicts that the collision would take place underground (i.e. at  y <  0 ). In order for the collision to take place above ground, we must enforce that y c   ( t coll )  >  0 . Using equation (10), this is equivalent to \u2212 g 2 L 2   +  H 2 v 2 0 +  H >  0 .

The mast, of height  h , is perfectly vertical. The initial distance between the top of the mast and the stone is assumed to be zero. 1. The sailboat is docked on land. The girl drops the stone, imparting no initial velocity. How long does it take for the stone to hit the foot of the mast? How far from the foot of the mast does the stone land? Ignore air resistance, and assume the deck of the boat is level with the water. 2. The girl takes the boat onto Lake Geneva and cruises with a constant horizontal velocity  \u20d7 v 0 . She repeats her stone dropping experiment from part 1. How long does it take for the stone to hit the deck or water? How far from the foot of the mast does the stone land? Ignore air resistance, and assume the deck of the boat is level with the water. It is 2300, and the girl and her sailboat can travel to space! During her interstellar space exploration, the boat is subject to a constant acceleration  \u20d7 a , which is parallel to the mast (i.e. \u201cupwards\u201d) with the magnitude of  | \u20d7 a |  =  a  = 9 . 81  m/s 2 . The girl repeats her stone dropping experiment as before. At the moment when the stone is dropped, the velocity of the vessel relative to the stars is colinear to the mast and has a norm  v 0 . Note that the dropped stone is subject to no acceleration. Again find the time for the stone to hit the deck and the distance it lands from the foot of the mast.  Hint: write the equation of motion for the stone as well as for the foot of the mast. ", "answer": "For parts 1 and 2 of this problem, we choose a coordinate system at rest with respect to the land when the boat is docked. The  z  axis is parallel to the mast and the  x  axis is horizontal (i.e. along to the ground). The origin corresponds to the foot of the mast at time  t  = 0 , when the stone is dropped. In part 3, we choose a 7  frame of reference relative to the fixed stars. The idea is to have a frame of reference that is fixed while the sailboat or the stone moves. In this problem, it is crucial to realize that the initial velocity of the dropped stone is equal to the velocity of the sailboat at the precise moment when the stone is dropped. 1. The dropped stone undergoes constant acceleration due to gravity  g  in the downwards direction. Thus, we can apply the equations of projectile motion z stone  ( t ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2  +  v z 0 t  +  z 0 . Given our coordinate system, the initial conditions of the stone are  v z 0  = 0  and  z 0  =  h . Thus, the equation of motion for the stone is z stone  ( t ) =  \u2212 1 2 gt 2  +  h. The time it takes the stone to reach the foot of the mast  t fall  is determined by the condition z stone  ( t fall ) = 0 , so we find t fall  = s 2 h g  . The dimensions are consistent as  [ s ] = p [ m ] / [ m / s 2 ]  as required. The distance that the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast is given by d  =  | x stone  ( t fall )  \u2212 x foot  ( t fall ) |  = 0 , where  |  . . .  |  is the absolute value (or magnitude) of the quantity within and  x foot ( t )  is the horizontal location of the foot of the mast. In the horizontal direction, the equation of motion for the stone is x stone ( t ) =  v x 0 t  +  x 0 . (27) However, since the initial conditions are  v x 0  = 0  and  x 0  = 0 , we find simply x stone ( t ) = 0 . Likewise, since the sailboat has no motion in the  x  direction, the equation of motion for the foot of the mast is also  x foot ( t ) = 0 . Thus, we find d  = 0 . 2. Since the velocity of the sailboat is solely in the  x  direction, the equation of motion in  z  is identical to that of part 1, z stone  ( t ) =  h  \u2212 1 2 gt 2 . Therefore, the time it takes for the stone to land remains t fall  = s 2 h g  . Now, since the sailboat moves with a constant velocity in the horizontal direction, the equation of motion in  x  for the foot of the mast is changed to x foot  ( t ) =  v 0 t. 8  However, the horizontal motion of the stone is also changed. Since the girl is riding the moving sailboat, when she drops it with no initial velocity  in her reference frame , it has an velocity  \u20d7 v 0  with respect to the reference frame of the land (in which we are doing the calculation). Thus, equation (27) becomes x stone  ( t ) =  v 0 t. Nevertheless, the distance the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast remains unchanged d  =  | x stone  ( t fall )  \u2212 x foot  ( t fall ) |  =  v 0 t fall  \u2212 v 0 t fall  = 0 . 3. Again, you must determine the equations of motion for the stone and the foot of the mast in the  z  and x  directions. In this part, we take a frame of reference at rest relative to the stars. As soon as the stone is released, it no longer experiences the constant acceleration. Thus, in the  z  direction, the stone follows z stone  ( t ) =  v 0 t  +  h, where we have already substituted the initial velocity and position of the stone. In the  x  direction, the stone has no initial motion or acceleration, so it follows x stone  ( t ) = 0 . The foot of the mast stays with the ship and continues to experience constant acceleration, so it follows z foot ( t ) =  1 2 at 2  +  v 0 t. The mast has no motion in the  x  direction, so x foot ( t ) = 0 . The stone reaches the foot of the mast when z stone  ( t fall ) =  z foot ( t fall ) . Substituting the equations of motion for both sides gives v 0 t fall  +  h  =  1 2 at 2 fall   +  v 0 t fall . Therefore, t fall  = r 2 h a  . Since  a  =  g , the time it takes the stone to reach the foot of the mast  t fall  remains the same as in parts 1 and 2. The distance the stone lands relative to the foot of the mast is still given by d  =  abs  ( x stone  ( t fall )  \u2212 x foot  ( t fall ))  , so, as before, the stone falls at the foot of the mast d  = 0 . 9  ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "The tortoise and the hare are racing a distance  L  along a straight track. The tortoise and hare start with constant velocities,  v t  and  v h  respectively. The hare is not taking this race seriously, so its velocity is less than the tortoise\u2019s. Once the tortoise arrives at a bridge a distance  L \u2032   < L  from the start, the hare realizes it could lose and accelerates with a constant acceleration  a . Express this problem mathematically. Find the condition on  a  that will allow the hare to win the race. Check your result in terms of units. Brainstorm limiting cases for which you have clear intuition about the solution. In these limiting cases, does your expression for  a  make sense? ", "answer": "In this problem we take as given the length of the race  L , the distance to the bridge  L \u2032 , the velocity of the tortoise  v t , and the initial velocity of the hare  v h . We must calculate the accelerate  a  needed for the hare to win the race. As in problem 3 of problem set 1, we will define  t 0  = 0  as the time the race starts,  t 1  as the time at which the tortoise reaches the bridge (which is when the hare starts to accelerate), and  t 2  as the arrival time of the tortoise. Additionally, can also define the time durations  \u2206 t  =  t 1  \u2212 t 0  and  \u2206 t \u2032   =  t 2  \u2212 t 1  of the first and second phases of the race respectively. We draw a schematic of the race in the figure below, where  x t  is the position of the tortoise and  x h  is the position of the hare. h During both phases of the race, the tortoise travels at the same constant speed  v t . Given that we have defined the origin to be its initial position, the tortoise\u2019s equation of motion is x t ( t ) =  v t t. Thus, it reaches the bridge when x t ( t 1 ) =  L \u2032   =  v t t 1 , so t 1  =   L \u2032 v t . (28) Similarly, the tortoise reaches the finish line when x t ( t 2 ) =  L  =  v t t 2 , so t 2  =   L v t . (29) During the first phase of the race (from  t 0  to  t 1 ), the hare maintains a constant speed  v h . Thus, its equation of motion is x h ( t ) =  v h t. However, when the  tortoise  reaches the bridge at time  t 1 , the  hare\u2019s  motion changes to constant acceleration a . At  t 1 , the hare\u2019s velocity is still  v h  and we can calculate its position to be x h ( t 1 ) =  v h t 1 . By substituting equation (28), we find x h ( t 1 ) =  L \u2032  v h v t . 10  The general equation of motion for constant acceleration can be found by integration (as we have done for the vertical direction of projectile motion) to be x h ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v h 0 t  +  x h 0 . From our analysis of the first phase, we know the initial position of the second phase is  x h 0  =  L \u2032 v h /v t , while the initial velocity of the second phase is  v h 0  =  v h . Therefore, the equation of motion becomes x h ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v h t  +  L \u2032  v h v t . Note that in this equation we have adopted a new time coordinate system, defined such that the time  t  = 0 corresponds to the start of the second phase of the race. Given this, we know that the hare must arrive at the finish line  x  =  L  at a time  t  =  t 2  \u2212 t 1  after the start of the second phase in order to tie the tortoise. This corresponds to the condition x h ( t 2  \u2212 t 1 ) =   a 2 ( t 2  \u2212 t 1 ) 2  +  v h ( t 2  \u2212 t 1 ) +  L \u2032  v h v t =  L. Using equations (28) and (29) to replace  t 1  and  t 2 , we find a 2 \u0012  L v t \u2212 L \u2032 v t \u0013 2 +  v h \u0012  L v t \u2212 L \u2032 v t \u0013 +  L \u2032  v h v t =  L. This equation contains only  a  and known quantities. To produce the simplest expression, we will first multiply the entire equation by  2 v 2 t   to find a  ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2   + 2 v t v h  ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) + 2 v t L \u2032 v h  = 2 v 2 t   L. Rearranging produces a  ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2   = 2 v 2 t   L  \u2212 2 v t v h L. Finally, simplifying further yields the solution of a  =  2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 . Therefore, in order for the hare to win the race, it must accelerate faster than this, producing the condition that a >   2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 . To verify our result, we can check the units h m s 2 i = \u0002  m s \u0003 [ m ] \u0002  m s \u0003 [ m ] 2 . We can also check the following limiting cases. Limiting case 1 : The tortoise has an initial velocity that is much greater than that of the hare. For this, we expect that the acceleration of the hare must be very large in order to beat the tortoise. Mathematically, we write this as  v t  \u2192\u221e . In this case the acceleration becomes lim v t \u2192\u221e a  = lim v t \u2192\u221e 2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 =  \u221e 11  Limiting case 2 : The tortoise and the hare have an equal velocity before the bridge. For this we expect that the hare does not need to accelerate at all in order to tie the race. Mathematically, we write this as v t  =  v h . We see that a  =  2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 = 0 . Limiting case 3 : The bridge is situated close to the finish line, making the second phase of the race very short. For this we expect that the hare\u2019s acceleration will need to be very large in order to win the race. Mathematically, we write this as  L \u2032   \u2192 L . We see that lim L \u2032 \u2192 L   a  = lim L \u2032 \u2192 L 2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 =  \u221e . 12  ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "A ship sails due southeast with a speed of  v  = 18  km/h.

What is this maximum distance? 2. Considering that the attacking player kicks the ball as described in part 1. How far should the defense be placed (from the opposing player) to counter her shot? The height of the defensive player\u2019s hand in the air is  h . ", "answer": "As indicated in the title, this problem is challenging. We start by defining the coordinate system such that y  is upwards in the vertical direction and  x  is in the horizontal direction of the initial velocity of the ball. The origin is located at the position where the ball is kicked. We will denote the initial speed of the ball by  v bi , which we know must be less than  v max bi . Using our general solution for projectile motion along with the initial position ( x 0  = 0  and  y 0  = 0 ) and velocity ( v x 0  =  v bi  cos  \u03b1  and  v y 0  =  v bi  sin  \u03b1 ), we can write the equations of motion for the ball as \u20d7 a b ( t ) =  \u2212 g \u02c6 y (7) \u20d7 v b ( t ) =  v x 0 \u02c6 x  + ( \u2212 gt  +  v y 0 ) \u02c6 y  =  v bi  cos  \u03b1 \u02c6 x  + ( \u2212 gt  +  v bi  sin  \u03b1 ) \u02c6 y (8) \u20d7 r b ( t ) = ( v x 0 t  +  x 0 ) \u02c6 x  + \u0010 \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v y 0 t  +  y 0 \u0011 \u02c6 y  =  v bi t  cos  \u03b1 \u02c6 x  + \u0010 \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v bi t  sin  \u03b1 \u0011 \u02c6 y. (9) 1. We want to find the distance at which the player catches the ball. To do so, we must first find the time at which the ball returns to the ground, which we will call  t 1 . The condition for the ball returning to the ground is  y b ( t 1 ) = 0 , so we can substitute the  \u02c6 y  component of equation (9) to find y b ( t 1 ) = 0 =  \u2212 g 2 t 2 1   +  v bi t 1   sin  \u03b1. (10) This equation has two solutions,  t 1  = 0  and t 1  =  2 v bi g sin  \u03b1. (11) The first solution corresponds to the time of the kick and the second corresponds to the catch, so the second solution is what we\u2019re looking for. By substituting this time into the equation for the horizontal position of the ball from equation (9), we can find the distance at which the ball lands to be x b ( t 1 ) =  v bi t 1  cos  \u03b1  =  2 v 2 bi g sin  \u03b1  cos  \u03b1. (12) Now we must analyze the player\u2019s motion. Since she runs at a constant velocity (that we will call  v p ) and her initial position is at the origin, her position is given by x p ( t ) =  v p t. (13) Thus, at time  t  =  t 1  her position is x p ( t 1 ) =  v p t 1  =  2 v bi v p g sin  \u03b1, (14) where we have made use of equation (11). The ball and the player must be at the same location for a catch to occur, which we will call  \u2113 = x b ( t 1 ) =  x p ( t 1 ) . Thus, we require equations (12) and (14) to be equal, which allows us to determine the initial angle of the ball v bi  cos  \u03b1  =  v p \u21d2 cos  \u03b1  =   v p v bi \u21d2 \u03b1  = arccos \u0012  v p v bi \u0013 . (15) To use this information to find a simple expression for  \u2113 , we can draw the triangle implied by this equation (shown below). After using the Pythagorean theorem to find that the length of the missing v p v bi \u03b1 side is q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p , we see that sin  \u03b1  = q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p v bi . (16) Substituting this result into equation (14) (or equation (12)) gives \u2113 =  2 g  v p q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p . (17) This is the expression for the distance at which the ball lands, which we want to maximize. To do so, we can immediately see that we want to increase the initial velocity of the ball as much as possible by setting v bi  =  v max bi . (18) This is also intuitively obvious. The harder you kick the ball, the more time it will be in the air and the more time the player will have to run. The dependence on  v p  is more complicated. We see that increasing it will increase the multiplying factor in front of the square root (thereby increasing  \u2113 ), but it will also decrease the quantity in the square root (thereby decreasing  \u2113 ). To find the maximum, we can remember our past analysis of projectile motion. The maximum vertical position occurred where the vertical velocity (which is the derivative of the vertical position) went to zero. This is a general technique to find the extrema (i.e. both maxima and minima) of functions: calculate the derivative and solve for the locations at which it is zero. Thus, we take equation (17) and calculate d\u2113 dv p = 0 =  2 g q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p   + 2 g  v p \uf8eb \uf8ed 1 2 \u2212 2 v p q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p \uf8f6 \uf8f8 =  2 g q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p   \u2212 2 g v 2 p q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p = 2 g q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p \u0000 v 2 bi   \u2212 2 v 2 p \u0001 (19) using the chain rule and product rules. Simplifying this expression, we find that there is only one extrema and it occurs at v p  =   v bi \u221a 2 . (20) Substituting this result into equation (17) and comparing with any other choice of  v p  (e.g.  v p  = 0 ), we can verify that this extrema is, in fact, a maxima (as opposed to a minima). Thus, this is the optimal speed that the player would ideally run at. If this isn\u2019t possible because  v p  =  v bi / \u221a 2  > v max p , the player should run as close as possible to this value, namely at their maximum speed of  v max p . Therefore, we have to explicitly distinguish these two possibilities by writing v p  = \u001a v max p if  v bi / \u221a 2  > v max p v bi / \u221a 2 otherwise   . (21) Combining equations (17), (18), and (21), we find that the maximum distance to catch the ball is \u2113 = ( (2 v max p /g ) q ( v max bi ) 2   \u2212 ( v max p ) 2 if  v max bi / \u221a 2  > v max p ( v max bi ) 2 /g otherwise . (22) Combining equations (15), (18), and (21), we find that ideal angle to kick the ball is \u03b1  = \u001a arccos \u0000 v max p /v max bi \u0001 if  v max bi / \u221a 2  > v max p arccos \u0000 1 / \u221a 2 \u0001 =  \u03c0/ 4 = 45 \u25e6 otherwise . (23) The interpretation of these results is that if you are sufficiently fast (i.e.  v max p is sufficiently large), the second case in all three equations applies. In this case, you want to kick the ball at  \u03b1  = 45 \u25e6 , as this is the angle that maximizes the distance traveled by the ball, and run below your maximum speed, such that you arrive at the same time and place as the ball when it lands. However, the more realistic case is the first, that you can out-kick your running speed. In this case you want to run at your maximum speed and angle your kick higher (i.e.  \u03b1 >  45 \u25e6 ) so that the ball stays in the air for longer and you have more time to run. 2. The position of the ball is given by equation (9). Using equations (15) and (16), we can write equation (9) as \u20d7 r b ( t ) =  v p t \u02c6 x  + \u0010 \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  t q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p \u0011 \u02c6 y. Solving the  x  component of this equation (i.e.  x b ( t ) =  v p t ) for time gives  t  =  x b /v p , which we can substitute into the  y  component to find y b ( x b ) =  \u2212 g 2 \u0012 x b v p \u0013 2 +   x b v p q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p   =  \u2212 g 2 v 2 p x 2 b   +  x b s v 2 bi v 2 p \u2212 1 . This is the trajectory of the ball. To find where the defense should be placed, we need to determine at what  x  position the height of the ball is equal to that of the defense player\u2019s hand. Therefore, we set y b ( x b ) =  h  to find h  =  \u2212 g 2 v 2 p x 2 b   +  x b s v 2 bi v 2 p \u2212 1 \u21d2 0 = g 2 v 2 p x 2 b   \u2212 x b s v 2 bi v 2 p \u2212 1 +  h, which we want to solve for  x b . This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve by first computing the discriminant \u2206=   v 2 bi v 2 p \u2212 1  \u2212 4   gh 2 v 2 p =   v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p   \u2212 2 gh v 2 p and then the solution x b  =   v p g \u0010q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p   \u00b1 q v 2 bi   \u2212 v 2 p   \u2212 2 gh \u0011 . We see there are 2 solutions \u2014 the shorter distance corresponds to the defense player catching the ball on its way up, and the longer distance corresponds to catching it on the way down. We arrive at the final answer by substituting equations (18) and (21) into the longer distance to get x b  = ( ( v max p /g ) \u0010q ( v max bi ) 2   \u2212 ( v max p ) 2   + q ( v max bi ) 2   \u2212 ( v max p ) 2   \u2212 2 gh \u0011 if  v max bi / \u221a 2  > v max p ( v max bi / (2 g )) \u0000p ( v max bi ) 2   + p ( v max bi ) 2   \u2212 4 gh \u0001 otherwise .

Briefly explain how you intend to model this problem and write down your strategy before solving it. 3. Use numbers from your everyday experience to estimate the height  h  and the time  t 1  and check if your answer makes sense. 2 ", "answer": "1. The acceleration, velocity, and position as a function of time are plotted below. 2. There are three stages of motion given in the problem and we note that the problem is one-dimensional. The first and third stages are at constant acceleration and the second stage is at constant velocity. We have seen similar problems before. The connection between the stages is that the final speed after the first stage is the constant speed during the second stage and the initial speed for the third stage. Additionally, the position at the end of the first stage is the initial position for the second stage and the position at the end of the second stage is the initial position for the third stage. 3. From projectile motion, we know the general solution for the acceleration, velocity, and position during any constant acceleration  a  is a ( t ) =  a v ( t ) =  at  +  v 0 y ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  +  y 0 respectively. During the first stage the acceleration is  a  =  a . Thus, after a time interval  t 1  the elevator has an upward speed and displacement of v 1  =  v ( t 1 ) =  at 1 \u2206 y 1  =  y ( t 1 )  \u2212 y 0  =   a 2 t 2 1 respectively, where we must remember that the acceleration  a  is positive and unknown. During the second stage, the elevator has a constant acceleration of  a  = 0 , so the upward speed and displacement are v ( t ) =  v 0  =  v 1  =  at 1 y ( t )  \u2212 y 0  =  v 0 t  =  v 1 t  =  at 1 t, where we note that here  t  is the time since the second stage began. Thus, after a time interval  \u2206 t 2  = 4 t 1 the elevator has a velocity and displacement of v 2  =  v (\u2206 t 2 ) =  at 1 \u2206 y 2  =  y (\u2206 t 2 )  \u2212 y 0  = 4 at 2 1 . During the third stage, we have constant acceleration of  a  =  \u2212 a , so the upward speed and displacement are v ( t ) =  \u2212 at  +  v 0  =  \u2212 at  +  at 1 y ( t )  \u2212 y 0  =  \u2212 a 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  =  \u2212 a 2 t 2  +  at 1 t. After a time interval  \u2206 t 3  =  t 1 , the upward speed and displacement is v 3  =  v (\u2206 t 3 ) = 0 \u2206 y 3  =  y (\u2206 t 3 )  \u2212 y 0  =  \u2212 a 2 t 2 1   +  at 1 t 1   =  a 2 t 2 1 respectively. Thus, the total distance traveled is the sum of the displacements in the three stages and is also equal to the height of the building  h , so h  = \u2206 y 1  + \u2206 y 2  + \u2206 y 3  =   a 2 t 2 1   + 4 at 2 1   +  a 2 t 2 1   = 5 at 2 1 .

In this part, the static friction can be considered to be  F s  \u2248 0  because the coefficient of static friction is so small. As we are analyzing circular motion, we choose a cylindrical coordinate system as shown in the figure below, where the unit vector  \u02c6 \u03c1  points in the outward radial direction,   \u02c6 \u03d5  points into the page around the curve, and  \u02c6 z  points upwards. The free body diagram on the car is also shown. \u03b1 R v N mg z \u03c1 \u03d5 Given the free body diagram and the form of the centripetal acceleration  \u20d7 a  =  \u2212 ( v 2 0 /R )\u02c6 \u03c1  for circular motion, Newton\u2019s second law   P  \u20d7 F  =  m\u20d7 a  in the  \u02c6 \u03c1  direction is \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 0 R  . We can tell that the trigonometric function in this equation is sine rather than cosine by imagining the case that  \u03b1  = 0 . If  \u03b1  = 0 , the  \u02c6 \u03c1  component of   \u20d7 N  would be 0. Since  sin(0) = 0  and  cos(0) = 1 , the  \u02c6 \u03c1 component of   \u20d7 N  should contain  sin( \u03b1 ) . In the  \u02c6 z  direction Newton\u2019s second law is N  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 mg  =  ma z . Because the car is traveling in a circle and does not slide up or down, the acceleration in the  \u02c6 z  direction is zero  a z  = 0 . Thus, the components of Newton\u2019s second law become N  sin  \u03b1  =   mv 2 0 R and N  cos  \u03b1  =  mg. Dividing these equations to eliminate  N  yields tan  \u03b1  =   v 2 0 Rg  , which we can solve for the speed  v 0  that is necessary to maintain circular motion. We find v 0  = p Rg  tan  \u03b1. We now reconsider the problem with a non-zero coefficient of static friction  \u00b5 s . In this part, the speed of the car  v  =  v min  is so slow that it just barely doesn\u2019t slip down the bank. The static friction force must point up the incline as we know that it is preventing the car from slipping down. The free body diagram on the car is shown in the figure below, from which we see that Newton\u2019s second law is \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  +  F s  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R in the  \u02c6 \u03c1  direction and N  cos  \u03b1  +  F s  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 mg  =  ma z in the  \u02c6 z  direction. \u03b1 R v N mg F s z \u03d5 \u03c1 When  v  =  v min , the car still isn\u2019t slipping so the acceleration in the  \u02c6 z  direction  a z  = 0  is still zero, but the static friction has its maximum magnitude of  F s  =  \u00b5 s N . Thus, Newton\u2019s second law becomes \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s N  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 min R and N  cos  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s N  sin  \u03b1  =  mg. Dividing these equations to eliminate  N  yields \u2212 sin  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1 =  \u2212 v 2 min Rg  , which can then be solved for the minimum speed necessary to avoid sliding down the embanked turn v min  = s Rg   sin  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1   = r Rg   tan  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s 1 +  \u00b5 s  tan  \u03b1 . The limiting cases of this result can be checked. In the limit  \u00b5 s  \u2192 0 ,  v min  \u2192 \u221a Rg  tan  \u03b1 , which is consistent with the result for part 1. In the limit  \u00b5 s  \u2192 tan  \u03b1 ,  v min  \u2192 0 , which is the solution for the static case of a block sitting on an incline. 3. We now consider the case where the car is at the maximum speed  v  =  v max  such that it is almost slipping up the inclined plane. For this case, the direction of static friction now points down the incline plane and the free body diagram is shown below. The analysis is identical to the previous case, except the static friction force changes sign. Thus Newton\u2019s second law become \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R (1) in the  \u02c6 \u03c1  direction and N  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 mg  = 0 (2) 2  \u03b1 R v N mg F s z \u03d5 \u03c1 in the  \u02c6 z  direction. When  v  =  v max , the static friction has its maximum value of  F s  =  \u00b5 s N , so Newton\u2019s second law becomes \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s N  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 max R and N  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s N  sin  \u03b1  =  mg. Dividing these two equations to eliminate  N  yields \u2212 sin  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1 =  \u2212 v 2 max Rg  , which can then be solved for the maximum speed  v max  to avoid sliding up the embanked turn v max  = s Rg   sin  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1   = r Rg   tan  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s 1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  tan  \u03b1 . This solution is identical to that of part 2, except the sign in front of  \u00b5 s  is opposite. The figure below shows a plot of  v 2 / ( Rg )  versus  \u00b5 s  when  \u03b1  = 45 \u25e6 . The shaded area represents the set of  ( \u00b5 s , v 2 / ( Rg ))  points where the car remains in a circular path.

The analysis is the same as in part 3, but the magnitude of the static friction is less than its maximum value. However, now the problem statement gives us the velocity  v  as a known quantity. Hence, we can combine equations (1) and (2) to eliminate  N  and solve for  F s . To do so, we multiply (1) by  cos  \u03b1 and (2) by  sin  \u03b1  to find \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  cos 2   \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R cos  \u03b1 3  and N  cos  \u03b1  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  sin 2   \u03b1  \u2212 mg  sin  \u03b1  = 0 .

From the free body diagram, we see that Newton\u2019s second law   P  \u20d7 F  =  m\u20d7 a  in the radial g mg T \u03c1 T \u03d5 \u03b8 direction is \u2212 T \u03c1  \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8  =  \u2212 mR\u03c9 2 , where we have used the fact that the centripetal acceleration needed for circular motion is  \u20d7 a  =  \u2212 R\u03c9 2 \u02c6 \u03c1 . Rearranging, we find the tension to be T \u03c1  =  mR\u03c9 2   \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8. Because the angular frequency is related to the period through  \u03c9  = 2 \u03c0/t 0 , the magnitude of the radial component of the tension in the string is T \u03c1 ( \u03b8 ) =  4 \u03c0 2 mR t 2 0 \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8. 2. A string cannot push. Thus, the magnitude of the radial component of the tension in the string  T \u03c1 must be greater than zero at all points in the circular motion. If  T \u03c1  <  0  the ball will move inwards and the path will no longer be circular. This means that, using the final result from part 1, circular motion will not be maintained if T \u03c1 ( \u03b8 ) =  4 \u03c0 2 mR t 2 0 \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8 <  0 4  at any point along the trajectory. From this equation we see that  \u03b8  = 0  (i.e. the top of the circle) is the most prone location to breakdown. This is because the gravitational term  \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8  makes its largest negative contribution to the required radial force  T \u03c1  (since  cos(0) = 1  is the maximum value of cos  \u03b8 ). Thus, taking  \u03b8  = 0  and solving the above equation for the period  t 0  gives the condition for the breakdown of circular motion.

The position vector in polar coordinates is  \u20d7 r  =  \u03c1 \u02c6 \u03c1  (which does not include a   \u02c6 \u03d5  component because the direction of the radial unit vector  \u02c6 \u03c1 changes with time such that it always points at the point mass). Thus, the spring-like force can be written as \u20d7 F 1  =  \u2212 mk 2   ( \u03c1 \u02c6 \u03c1 )  . The problem statement gives the form of the velocity in polar coordinates, which we can substitute to write the friction-type force as \u20d7 F 2  =  \u2212 2 m\u03bb \u0010 \u02d9 \u03c1 \u02c6 \u03c1  +  \u03c1   \u02d9 \u03d5 \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 .

Substituting our solution for  \u03c1 ( t ) , we find \u02d9 \u03d5  =  \u00b1 p k 2   \u2212 \u03bb 2 , where we note that this is a real number as the problem statement tells us that  k > \u03bb . Integrating this equation with respect to time and using the initial condition that  \u03d5  (0) = 0  to determine the integration constant, we find \u03d5  ( t ) =  \u00b1 t p k 2   \u2212 \u03bb 2 .

He pulls down on each rope with a force of magnitude  F  and accelerates upward with a uniform acceleration. Find this uniform acceleration  a . ", "answer": "We will explain two different, equally valid approaches to this question. The first method is to draw two separate free body diagrams, one for the painter and one for the platform (both shown below). Since the pulleys are both massless and frictionless, the tension throughout each rope is  F , the magnitude of the force the painter applies to each rope. The painter pulls the ropes downward, so the ropes exert an equal and opposite upward force on the painter by Newton\u2019s third law. Thus, the tension from the ropes pull upwards on both the painter and the platform. Additionally, the platform exerts an upward normal force on the painter, the magnitude of which we denote as  N . By Newton\u2019s third law, there is a reaction normal force from the painter on the platform, which has an equal magnitude  N  and is in the opposite direction. Lastly, there is a downwards gravitational force  m 1 g  on the painter and  m 2 g  on the platform. Painter y F F N m 1 g Platform F F N m 2 g Let  a 1  denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the painter and  a 2  denote the magnitude of the acceleration of the platform. Since the painter is standing on the platform, they both have the same acceleration upwards. Thus, we know a 1  =  a 2  =  a, (1) where we have denoted the common acceleration by the symbol  a . Applying Newton\u2019s second law to the painter in the vertical direction gives 2 F  +  N  \u2212 m 1 g  =  m 1 a, (2) while applying Newton\u2019s second law to the platform in the vertical direction gives 2 F  \u2212 N  \u2212 m 2 g  =  m 2 a.

As is typical, the coefficient of static friction between the blocks and the tables is greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction,  \u00b5 s  > \u00b5 k . 1. Imagine that, when the system is released from rest, you know block 3 accelerates downward with a constant magnitude  a , but only one of the other blocks moves. Which block does not move, and what is the magnitude and direction of the friction force holding it back? 2. Now consider the case where, after the blocks are released from rest, all three of them begin to move. Find the acceleration of all three blocks and the tension in the rope. 1 Applications of Newton\u2019s second law", "answer": "1. In this part, the vertical acceleration of block 3,  a 3 y  =  a , is a given quantity. Let  T  be the tension in the rope, which is constant throughout its length (as the rope is massless and the pulleys are massless and frictionless). The free body diagram on block 3 is shown below. Defining a coordinate system such that  \u02c6 y  points up (antiparallel to gravity), we find Newton\u2019s second law becomes 2 T  \u2212 m 3 g  =  \u2212 m 3 a (1) for block 3. We can solve this to find the tension T  =  1 2 m 3 ( g  \u2212 a ) . (2)  The problem tells us that the tension  T  exceeds the static friction force limit on one block, but not the other. To see which, we must calculate the static friction force, which requires us to know the normal forces. Thus, we draw the free body diagrams for both blocks (shown below), where  f 1  and  f 2 represent the friction force on each. We know that the friction force (whether it be static or kinetic) will point outwards as block 3 will tend to pull blocks 1 and 2 towards the pulleys. Since blocks 1 and 2 do not accelerate vertically, Newton\u2019s second law in the vertical direction gives N 1  \u2212 m 1 g  = 0 \u21d2 N 1  =  m 1 g (3) and N 2  \u2212 m 2 g  = 0 \u21d2 N 2  =  m 2 g (4) for blocks 1 and 2 respectively. Substituting this into the equation for the static friction force gives f 1  \u2264 \u00b5 s N 1  =  \u00b5 s m 1 g (5) and f 2  \u2264 \u00b5 s N 2  =  \u00b5 s m 2 g, (6) where we have used the same coefficient of static friction in both equations as the two blocks (and the tables they sit on) are made of the same material. From this we conclude that block 1 does  not  move and block 2  does  move because the maximum static friction force is higher on block 1 since  m 1  > m 2 . Since block 1 does not move, we can write the horizontal component of Newton\u2019s second law as T  \u2212 f 1  = 0 , (7) where we have defined  \u02c6 x  to point towards the right. Solving this equation for the friction force and substituting equation (2) gives the final answer \u2014 block 1 does not move and the friction force holding it back points horizontally to the left with magnitude f 1  =  1 2 m 3 ( g  \u2212 a ) . (8) Note we know that  g > a  as block 3 would only accelerate at  g  if it were in free fall. Any upwards force (such as that from the rope) would only serve to slow its downwards acceleration. 2. Now consider the case where, after being released from rest, all three blocks begin to move. We are trying to solve for the accelerations  a 1 x ,  a 2 x , and  a 3 y  as well as the tension  T  in the rope. Thus, to solve for these 4 unknowns we need four equations. The free body diagrams for all three blocks remain the same (shown above), though all the friction forces are kinetic friction as every block is now moving. For all objects, we will choose to use a single coordinate system with  \u02c6 y  pointing upward and  \u02c6 x  pointing to the right, though other choices are possible. Given this coordinate system, Newton\u2019s second law for block 1 is T  \u2212 f 1  =  m 1 a 1 x (9) in the horizontal direction, while it is N 1  \u2212 m 1 g  = 0 (10)  in the vertical direction (since there is no vertical acceleration). Therefore, as in part 1, we find N 1  =  m 1 g, (11) so the  kinetic  friction force is f 1  =  \u00b5 k N 1  =  \u00b5 k m 1 g. (12) Substituting this into equation (9) gives T  \u2212 \u00b5 k m 1 g  =  m 1 a 1 x . (13) Next, we consider block 2. Given its free body diagram (shown above), Newton\u2019s second law is f 2  \u2212 T  =  m 2 a 2 x (14) in the horizontal direction, while it is N 2  \u2212 m 2 g  = 0 (15) in the vertical direction (since there is no vertical acceleration). Therefore, as in part 1, we find N 2  =  m 2 g, (16) so the  kinetic  friction force is f 2  =  \u00b5 k N 2  =  \u00b5 k m 2 g. (17) Substituting this into equation (14) gives \u00b5 k m 2 g  \u2212 T  =  m 2 a 2 x . (18) Lastly, we turn to block 3. Given its free body diagram (shown above), Newton\u2019s second law is 2 T  \u2212 m 3 g  =  m 3 a 3 y (19) in the vertical direction and  0 = 0  in the horizontal direction. We can collect the equations for the three blocks (equations (13), (18), and (19)): T  \u2212 \u00b5 k m 1 g  =  m 1 a 1 x (20) \u00b5 k m 2 g  \u2212 T  =  m 2 a 2 x (21) 2 T  \u2212 m 3 g  =  m 3 a 3 y . (22) g x 1 x 2 m 2 m 1 m 3 y 3 y x s 3 s 2 s 1  However, we are still missing one equation (given that we have four unknowns and only three equations). This is the constraint condition. More specifically, studying the geometry of the system (see the figure above), we see that the motion of the three blocks is related by a geometrical constraint: because the rope is inextensible (i.e. does not stretch), its length  L  is constant. However, quantifying its length is complicated given that the blocks move. There are many different approaches to do this, which will give the same answer. We choose to define a single coordinate system for all three blocks and place its origin equidistant between the center of the two fixed pulleys (as shown above). Then we quantify some missing fixed distances (e.g. the radii of the pulleys  R ), which, as we will see, won\u2019t end up mattering as they don\u2019t change as the blocks move. Finally, we can add up all the sections of rope to express the total length of the rope as L  = ( \u2212 x 1 + s 1 )+   \u03c0 2   R +( \u2212 y 3 + s 3 )+ \u03c0R +( \u2212 y 3 + s 3 )+  \u03c0 2   R +( x 2 \u2212 s 2 ) =  \u2212 x 1 + x 2 \u2212 2 y 3 + s 1 \u2212 s 2 +2 s 3 +2 \u03c0R. (23) Note that we have accounted for the fact that some of the positions (e.g.  x 1  and  y 3 ) will be negative, given our definitions of  \u02c6 x  and  \u02c6 y . If we differentiate equation (23) twice with respect to time, we find 0 =  \u2212 a 1 x  +  a 2 x  \u2212 2 a 3 y . (24) Note that all of the unknown distances, like  R  and  s 1 , have disappeared as they don\u2019t change with time. Equation (24) is the equation that we were missing. We now have four equations (i.e. (20), (21), (22), and (24)) with which we can solve for the four unknowns ( a 1 x , a 2 x ,  a 3 y , and the tension  T ). We solve equation (20) to find a 1 x  =   T m 1 \u2212 \u00b5 k g, (25) equation (21) to find a 2 x  =  \u00b5 k g  \u2212 T m 2 , (26) and equation (22) to find a 3 y  =  2 T m 3 \u2212 g. (27) Substituting these three results into equation (24) gives 0 =  \u2212 \u0012  T m 1 \u2212 \u00b5 k g \u0013 + \u0012 \u00b5 k g  \u2212 T m 2 \u0013 \u2212 2 \u0012  2 T m 3 \u2212 g \u0013 . (28) We rearrange this equation to find that the tension is T  = 2 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 1 m 1   + 1 m 2   + 4 m 3 \u0011 . (29) We can now substitute our solution for the tension to find the accelerations. Equation (25) becomes a 1 x  = 2 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 1 +   m 1 m 2   +  4 m 1 m 3 \u0011  \u2212 \u00b5 k g, (30) equation (26) becomes a 2 x  =  \u00b5 k g  \u2212 2 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 m 2 m 1   + 1 + 4  m 2 m 3 \u0011 , (31)  and equation (27) becomes a 3 y  = 4 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 m 3 m 1   +  m 3 m 2   + 4 \u0011  \u2212 g. (32) Note that the signs of these accelerations depend on the coordinate system used and so may be different in your solution. However, the tension given by equation (29) is a physical force and is independent of the choice of coordinates.

However, since it is uniform, it has a constant linear mass density  \u03bb  =  m 1 /\u2113 , which is everywhere equal to the total mass of the rope  m 1  divided by its total length  \u2113 . We can divide the rope into very small pieces of length  \u2206 \u03c1  in the radial direction, which each have a mass of \u2206 m  =  \u03bb \u2206 \u03c1  =   m 1 \u2113 \u2206 \u03c1.

The net radial force on the piece is equal to the difference between the tension on either side X F \u03c1  =  T ( \u03c1  + \u2206 \u03c1 )  \u2212 T ( \u03c1 ) = \u2206 T, (2) which is simply the change in tension across the piece  \u2206 T . Given that the piece is executing uniform circular motion, we know it is experiencing a centripetal acceleration of  \u20d7 a  =  \u2212 \u03c1\u03c9 2 \u02c6 \u03c1 . Thus, the radial component of Newton\u2019s second law must be X F \u03c1  =  \u2212 \u2206 m\u03c9 2 \u03c1. (3) Combining equations (1), (2), and (3) gives \u2206 T  =  \u2212 \u2206 m\u03c9 2 \u03c1  =  \u2212 m 1 \u2113 \u2206 \u03c1\u03c9 2 \u03c1. (4) Dividing by  \u2206 \u03c1 , we see that \u2206 T \u2206 \u03c1   =  \u2212 m 1 \u2113 \u03c9 2 \u03c1. (5)  In the limit that our very small pieces become infinitesimally small (i.e.  \u2206 \u03c1  \u2192 0 ), equation (5) becomes the differential equation dT d\u03c1   =  \u2212 m 1 \u2113 \u03c9 2 \u03c1. (6) From this, we see immediately that the tension decreases with increasing radius as  m 1 ,  \u2113 ,  \u03c9 2 , and  \u03c1  are all positive quantities. We can solve this differential equation by direct integration of both sides of the equation according to Z  dT d\u03c1  d\u03c1  =  \u2212 m 1 \u03c9 2 \u2113 Z \u03c1d\u03c1. (7) This simplifies to T ( \u03c1 ) =  \u2212 m 1 \u03c9 2 2 \u2113 \u03c1 2   +  C, (8) where  C  is an integration constant that we still need to determine. To find it, we need to determine the value of the tension at some location. To do so, we use the fact that the only radial force applied at the end of the rope is by the mass  m 2 . Using the free body diagram for mass  m 2  (shown above), we see that Newton\u2019s second law in the radial direction is \u2212 T ( \u2113 )\u02c6 \u03c1  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 \u2113 \u02c6 \u03c1 \u21d2 T ( \u2113 ) =  m 2 \u03c9 2 \u2113.

What acceleration do you perceive her as having? 2 Applications of Newton\u2019s second law ", "answer": "The most challenging part of this problem is understanding and determining the physical meaning of each of the quantities from our derivation in class. In this solution we will simply state the physical meanings, but these can be seen and justified through the derivation presented in class. The first thing to note is that the mass of your own car  m 1  does not matter at all in this problem. We already know the motion of your car (and importantly the motion of the reference frame it defines) and we are not interested in calculating the forces on your car. Since the cars are executing circular motion, we can define a fixed cylindrical coordinate system  F  with the origin at the center of the circular curve and the  \u02c6 z  direction defined such that  \u03c9 1  and  \u03c9 2  are both in the positive  \u02c6 z  direction. Additionally, we observe that both cars are moving with the same angular velocity, which we will call  \u20d7 \u03c9  =  \u03c9 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  =  v 1 /R 1 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c9 2 \u02c6 z  =  v 2 /R 2 \u02c6 z . Next, we can write down the general coordinate system transformation for forces between the fixed inertial reference frame  F  and a non-inertial reference frame  N  rotating with an angular velocity  \u20d7 \u03c9 1 . As derived in class, it is \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  = \u03a3 \u20d7 F F  \u2212 m 2   \u20d7 A F N  \u2212 2 m 2 \u20d7 \u03c9 1  \u00d7  \u20d7 v N  \u2212 m 2 \u20d7 \u03b1 1  \u00d7  \u20d7 r N  \u2212 m 2 \u20d7 \u03c9 1  \u00d7  ( \u20d7 \u03c9 1  \u00d7  \u20d7 r N )  . (1) Here  \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  is the sum of the forces acting on your friend\u2019s car, as perceived in the non-inertial reference frame N  (in this case defined by the motion of your car). This is what we want to determine in order to solve the problem. The quantity  \u03a3 \u20d7 F F  is the sum of the standard forces acting on your friend\u2019s car in the fixed inertial reference frame  F  (i.e. someone standing at the center of the curve watching the cars drive by). In  the inertial reference frame, your friend\u2019s car is moving with uniform circular motion of radius  R 2 , so the sum of the forces acting on them must be a centripetal force \u03a3 \u20d7 F F  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 2 R 2 \u02c6 \u03c1. (2) In practice this would be provided by the static friction force between the car tires and the road. Note that all the masses that appear are  m 2  because we are only considering the forces acting on your friend\u2019s car, which has mass  m 2 . The rest of the terms represent fictitious forces. The first is the translational acceleration fictitious force. The quantity   \u20d7 A F N  is the acceleration of the reference frame  N , as seen from the fixed frame  F . Since the reference frame  N  is defined by your car and you are executing uniform circular motion in frame  F , we know that the acceleration must be centripetal \u20d7 A F N  =  \u2212 \u03c9 2 1 R 1 \u02c6 \u03c1. (3) Note that the angular speed and radius are that of  your  car (i.e.  \u03c9 1  and  R 1 ). The next term is the Coriolis force, which includes the velocity of your friend\u2019s car  \u20d7 v N  as seen by you in frame N . Intuitively, since both cars are traveling with the same angular velocity  \u03c9 1  =  \u03c9 2 , from your perspective your friend\u2019s car is staying stationary beside you. Her position relative to you would be a constant vector pointing outwards \u20d7 r N  = ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1. (4) Then, taking a derivative in time justifies our intuitive argument that \u20d7 v N  = 0 . (5) Note, in this step we have considered the unit vectors to be constant as we are determining how the position changes with time from the perspective of you within the reference frame  N . In other words, from your perspective facing forwards in your car (i.e. continuously facing in the   \u02c6 \u03d5  direction) and believing yourself to be at rest, your friend\u2019s position is not changing with time. Thus, the Coriolis force is zero. The next term is the Euler force, where  \u20d7 \u03b1 1  = \u02d9 \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  is the angular acceleration of reference frame  N . Since you are driving at a constant speed,  \u02d9 \u03c9 1  = 0 , so  \u20d7 \u03b1 1  = 0  and the Euler force disappears. The final term is the centrifugal force, where we have already determined that the position of your friend\u2019s car from your perspective in frame  N  is given by equation (4). Thus, the centrifugal force is non-zero and equation (4) can be substituted into equation (1). Collecting all of the results from above, we can rewrite equation (1) as \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 2 R 2 \u02c6 \u03c1  +  m 2 \u03c9 2 1 R 1 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  \u00d7  ( \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  \u00d7  ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1 )  . (6) Using the fact that  \u03c9  =  \u03c9 1  =  \u03c9 2  and taking the scalars out in front of the cross products allows us to simplify to \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 z  \u00d7  (\u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u02c6 \u03c1 )  . (7) In the right-handed  ( \u03c1, \u03d5, z )  coordinate system, we can use the right hand rule to see that  \u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u02c6 \u03c1  =  \u02c6 \u03d5  and \u02c6 z  \u00d7  (\u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u02c6 \u03c1 ) = \u02c6 z  \u00d7   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u02c6 \u03c1 , so \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1  +  m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1  = 0 . (8) Thus, from your perspective in the non-inertial reference frame  N  of your car, you see no net force acting on your friend\u2019s car. This differs from a fixed reference frame  F , in which you would observe a physical centripetal force (provided by static friction between your friend\u2019s car and the road) as given by equation (2). The lack of a net force in frame  N  arises from a cancellation between the physical centripetal force, the translational acceleration fictitious force, and the centrifugal fictitious force.  Since the net force is zero, Newton\u2019s first or second laws tells us that the acceleration  \u20d7 a N  is zero. Newton\u2019s first and second laws (but not the third) are still valid in non-inertial reference frames, as long as all of the fictitious forces are properly included. Alternatively,  \u20d7 a N  = 0  can be seen by taking the time derivative of equation (5).

For this part of the problem, it would be more efficient to analyze the situation by considering the two coins as a single combined object, which enables us to ignore internal forces (e.g. the normal and friction forces between the two coins). However, it will be helpful for the second part of this problem to treat the two coins separately. Thus, we will start by drawing separate free body diagrams for each coin (shown below). We have the weight of each coin  m\u20d7 g , the forces of static friction between the coins (both action   \u20d7 f bt and reaction   \u20d7 f tb  =  \u2212 \u20d7 f bt ), the force of static friction from the turntable on the bottom coin   \u20d7 f gb , the normal forces between the coins (both action   \u20d7 N bt  and reaction   \u20d7 N tb  =  \u2212 \u20d7 N bt ), and the normal force of the turntable on the bottom coin   \u20d7 N gb . Here the top coin is denoted by the  t  subscript, the bottom coin by  b , and the turntable by  g . R \u03c9 \u03c1 z \u03d5 Top coin N bt f bt mg Bottom coin N gb f tb mg N tb f gb To determine the magnitude of the radial force exerted by the turntable on the bottom coin   \u20d7 f gb , we will apply Newton\u2019s second law to each coin. A key point is that the static friction between the coins form an action-reaction pair, so the static friction that makes the top coin accelerate inward also acts to push the bottom coin radially outward. The radial component of Newton\u2019s second law for the bottom coin is f tb  \u2212 f gb  =  \u2212 mR\u03c9 2 , (1) where we\u2019ve used that the centripetal acceleration is  \u20d7 a  =  \u2212 R\u03c9 2 \u02c6 \u03c1 . The radial component of Newton\u2019s second law on the top coin is given by \u2212 f bt  =  \u2212 mR\u03c9 2 \u21d2 f bt  =  mR\u03c9 2 . (2) Since the static friction force of the bottom coin on the top coin  f bt  and the static friction force of the top coin on the bottom coin  f tb  are an action-reaction pair, Newton\u2019s third law requires that their magnitudes respect  f bt  =  f tb . Substituting this into equation (2) gives f tb  =  mR\u03c9 2 . (3)   Then substituting equation (3) into equation (1) yields mR\u03c9 2   \u2212 f gb  =  \u2212 mR\u03c9 2 . (4) Hence the turntable exerts a inward radial force on the bottom coin with a magnitude of f gb  = 2 mR\u03c9 2 . (5) Comparing with equation (2), we see that the static friction force on the bottom coin from the turntable is twice as large as the static friction force on the top coin. 2. When two surfaces slip, it is because the static friction force required to hold them in place has exceeded its maximum possible strength of  f   max   =  \u00b5N . To calculate this, we must first find the magnitude of the normal force  N  between the relevant surfaces. Applying Newton\u2019s second law to the top coin in the vertical  \u02c6 z  direction yields N bt  \u2212 mg  = 0 , (6) where we note that none of the objects in this problem are accelerating vertically so  a z  = 0 . Thus, we can calculate the normal force of the bottom coin on the top coin to be N bt  =  mg. (7) Since this force forms an action-reaction pair with the normal force of the top coin on the bottom coin, we know that their magnitudes follow  N tb  =  N bt  =  mg . Substituting equation (7) into the form of the static friction force, we see that the top coin will slip when the static friction between the two coins reaches its maximum value of f   max bt =  \u00b5 2 N bt  =  \u00b5 2 mg. (8) We then substitute this result into equation (2) to find \u00b5 2 mg  =  mR  ( \u03c9 max t ) 2   , (9) where  \u03c9 max t is the maximum angular speed for which the top coin does not slip. Rearranging this, we find \u03c9 max t = r \u00b5 2 g R  . (10) Newton\u2019s second law for the bottom coin in the  \u02c6 z  direction is N gb  \u2212 N tb  \u2212 mg  = 0 . (11) Noting again from Newton\u2019s third law that  N tb  =  N bt  =  mg , we can rearrange this equation to show that the normal force between the turntable and the bottom coin is N gb  = 2 mg. (12) Using this and the form of the static friction force, we see that the bottom coin will slip when the static friction between it and the turntable exceeds f   max gb =  \u00b5N gb  = 2 \u00b5 1 mg. (13) From equation (5), we can determine that the maximum angular speed after which the bottom coin slips will satisfy 2 \u00b5 1 mg  = 2 mR  ( \u03c9 max b ) 2   . (14)   Rearranging we find that \u03c9 max b = r \u00b5 1 g R  . (15) Comparing equations (10) and (15) and remembering that  \u00b5 2  < \u00b5 1 , we see that \u03c9 max t < \u03c9 max b .

Next, we\u2019ll decompose the rods into differential elements of mass  \u2206 m  and consider the element located a distance  x  from the origin. Since the rod is uniform, the linear mass density is \u03bb  =   M L (1) as well as \u03bb  =  \u2206 m \u2206 x  , (2) where  \u2206 x  is the length of the differential element. Taking the limit of equation (2) as  \u2206 x  \u2192 0  gives \u03bb  =   dm dx  . (3) The center of mass for a continuous system is defined by \u20d7 R CM  = R M   \u20d7 rdm R M   dm , (4) where R M ( . . . ) dm  indicates an integral over the entire mass distribution of the whole object. We can perform a change of variables from mass to position to find \u20d7 R CM  = R  L 0   \u20d7 r   dm dx   dx R  L 0 dm dx   dx , (5) where R  L 0   ( . . . ) dx  indicates an integral over the entire length of the object. Then substituting equation (3) we find \u20d7 R CM  = R  L 0   \u20d7 r\u03bbdx R  L 0   \u03bbdx = R  L 0   ( x \u02c6 x ) \u03bbdx \u03bb ( L  \u2212 0) = R  L 0   xdx \u02c6 x L =  ( x 2 / 2] x = L x =0 L \u02c6 x  =   L 2 / 2  \u2212 0 L \u02c6 x  =   L 2  \u02c6 x. (6) As expected from the symmetry of a uniform rod, the center of mass is exactly in the middle. 2. We will use the same coordinate system as in part 1 and again consider a differential mass element \u2206 m  located a distance  x  from the origin. The linear mass density  \u03bb ( x )  is no longer uniform along the length of the rod, so  \u03bb  \u0338 =  M/L  at every point. However, the definition of the local linear mass density is \u03bb ( x ) = lim \u2206 x \u2192 0 \u2206 m \u2206 x  , (7) where  \u2206 x  is the length of the differential element. Since the right side is the definition of the derivative, we have \u03bb ( x ) =   dm dx  . (8) Substituting the functional form of the density from the problem statement gives dm dx   =  \u03bb 0 x L . (9) The total mass is found by summing the mass elements over the entire length of the rod according to M  = Z M dm. (10) Performing a change of variables to position and substituting equation (9) gives M  = Z  L 0 dm dx  dx  = Z  L 0 \u03bb 0 x L dx  =  \u03bb 0 L Z  L 0 xdx  =   \u03bb 0 L \u0012 x 2 2 \u0015 x = L x =0 =   \u03bb 0 2 L ( L 2  \u2212 0) =  \u03bb 0 2   L. (11) Since the problem gives us both  M  and  L  as known quantities, we can solve this equation for  \u03bb 0  to find \u03bb 0  =  2 M L  . (12) The definition of the center of mass is \u20d7 R CM  = R M   \u20d7 rdm R M   dm . (13) We can calculate the numerator in a similar way as above to find \u20d7 R CM  = R  L 0   \u20d7 r   dm dx   dx M =  1 M Z  L 0 ( x \u02c6 x ) \u03bb 0 x L dx  =  \u03bb 0 ML Z  L 0 x 2 dx \u02c6 x  =   \u03bb 0 ML \u0012 x 3 3 \u0015 x = L x =0 \u02c6 x  =   \u03bb 0 L 2 3 M   \u02c6 x, (14) where we have used equation (9). Using equation (12), we can simplify further to find \u20d7 R CM  =  2 M L L 2 3 M   \u02c6 x  =  2 3 L \u02c6 x.

As for the center of mass acceleration, since the net external force on the system is zero we know that the center of mass acceleration is zero \u20d7 F   ext net   =  M \u20d7 A CM  = 0 \u21d2 \u20d7 A CM  = 0 . (3) Thus, due to the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration, we know that the center of mass velocity is constant in time \u20d7 V CM ( t ) =   \u20d7 V CM (0) . (4) As an aside, for systems with constant mass, having a constant center of mass velocity ( \u20d7 V CM ( t ) =  constant) is equivalent to conservation of momentum ( \u20d7 p sys ( t ) =   P N i =1   m i \u20d7 v i ( t ) =  constant) as equation (2) shows that \u20d7 V CM ( t ) =  \u20d7 p sys ( t ) /   P N i =1   m i . Next, if the center of mass velocity is constant, then we know that the center of mass position is linear in time \u20d7 R CM ( t ) =   \u20d7 V CM (0) t  +   \u20d7 R CM (0) . (5) Thus, we just need to find the initial center of mass position   \u20d7 R CM (0)  and initial center of mass velocity \u20d7 V CM (0) . Since the problem statement gives us the state of the system at  t  = 0 , we can compute these quantities using equations (1) and (2). We will first calculate the center of mass position. At  t  = 0 , we can deduce that the center of mass of the rod is \u20d7 r 1 (0) =   L 2  \u02c6 y (6) by symmetry. Alternatively, as in part 1 of problem 1 above, this could be found by integrating over the constant mass distribution  \u03bb  =  M/L  =  dm/dy  of the rod according to \u20d7 r 1 (0) = R M   \u20d7 rdm R M   dm  = R  L 0   \u20d7 r\u03bbdy R  L 0   \u03bbdy =   \u03bb R  L 0   y \u02c6 ydy \u03bb R  L 0   dy = R  L 0   ydy R  L 0   dy \u02c6 y  =  ( y 2 / 2] y = L y =0 ( y ] L 0 \u02c6 y  =   L 2 / 2  \u2212 0 L  \u2212 0 \u02c6 y  =   L 2  \u02c6 y, (7) where R M ( . . . ) dm  indicates an integral over the entire mass distribution of the whole object. At time  t  = 0 , the particle is at the origin, so its center of mass is at \u20d7 r 2 (0) = 0 . (8) Thus, substituting equations (6) and (8) into equation (1), we see that the center of mass of the whole system at time  t  = 0  is \u20d7 R CM (0) =  ( L/ 2)\u02c6 y  + 0 2 =   L 4  \u02c6 y. (9) The initial center of mass velocity can be found in a similar manner. The rod is at rest at  t  = 0 , so  \u20d7 v 1 (0) = 0 . At time  t  = 0 , the particle is moving in the positive  x -direction with a velocity  \u20d7 v 2 (0) =  V 0 \u02c6 x . Thus, equation (2) tells us that the velocity of the center of mass of the system at  t  = 0  is \u20d7 V CM (0) =  0 +  V 0 \u02c6 x 2 =   V 0 2  \u02c6 x. (10) Thus, substituting equation (10) into equation 4 gives \u20d7 V CM ( t ) =   V 0 2  \u02c6 x (11) and substituting equations (9) and (10) into equation 5 gives \u20d7 R CM ( t ) =   V 0 2   t \u02c6 x  +   L 4  \u02c6 y.

This choice is sensible as we will then know that L  =  x 1 ( t 1 ) , (1) i.e. the position of  m 1  will be identical to the distance traveled since  t  =  t 0  (which is what the problem asks us to calculate). Additionally we note that the problem is one-dimensional, so we will only need to consider the  \u02c6 x  direction. Since there is no external force on the two-particle system, we know that the acceleration of the center of mass is zero, regardless of the force between the objects. Thus, we know that the center of mass velocity is constant in time V CM ( t ) = P N i =1   m i v i P N i =1   m i =   m 1 v 1 ( t ) +  m 2 v 2 ( t ) m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 ) (2) and, thus, doesn\u2019t change from its value at  t  =  t 0 . This is significant because the problem statement gives us information about the system at  t  =  t 0 . Since the center of mass velocity is constant, we know that the center of mass position is linear in time. We can write it as X CM ( t ) = P N i =1   m i x i P N i =1   m i =   m 1 x 1 ( t ) +  m 2 x 2 ( t ) m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 )( t  \u2212 t 0 ) +  X CM ( t 0 ) , (3) where we have chosen the form of our linear function to depend only on quantities at  t  =  t 0 , again because that is the time that the problem statement gives us information about. To determine the center of mass velocity at  t  =  t 0 , we substitute the facts from the problem statement that v 1 ( t 0 ) =  v 0  and  v 2 ( t 0 ) = 0  into equation (2) to find V CM ( t 0 ) =   m 1 v 0  +  m 2 (0) m 1  +  m 2 = m 1 m 1  +  m 2 v 0 . (4) To determine the center of mass position at  t  =  t 0 , we substitute the facts from the problem statement that x 1 ( t 0 ) = 0  (due to the definition of our origin) and  x 2 ( t 0 ) =  d  into equation (3) to find X CM ( t 0 ) =   m 1 (0) +  m 2 d m 1  +  m 2 =  V CM ( t 0 )( t 0  \u2212 t 0 ) +  X CM ( t 0 ) \u21d2 X CM ( t 0 ) = m 2 m 1  +  m 2 d.

(6) The final crucial insight is to recognize that the center of mass position at  t  =  t 1  is position of the collision. Since the particles are colliding (and are small), both particles are at the same location, which also must be the center of mass. Thus, we have x 1 ( t 1 ) =  x 2 ( t 1 ) =  X CM ( t 1 ) .

We can solve this equation by substitution.

Write your answer in terms of some or all of the following:  m A ,  m C ,  g ,  h 0 , and  v 0 . ", "answer": "We start by defining our system to include both the acrobat and the clown. The first important observation is that there is a collision between the acrobat and the clown. This collision is completely \u201cinelastic\u201d in that the two bodies collide and stick together after the collision. The details of the collision are determined by the internal forces in the system. Since this is a one-dimensional motion, we will use a coordinate system with the origin at the trampoline and  \u02c6 y  defined to be upwards. There are two important states to identify in this problem. State 1 is immediately before the collision, at a time that we\u2019ll call  t 1 . At this moment, acrobat has just arrived at the platform of the clown, so both are at the same position y A ( t 1 ) =  y C ( t 1 ) =  h 0 , (1) where  y A ( t )  and  y C ( t )  are the vertical positions of the acrobat and clown respectively. Additionally, just before grabbing the clown the acrobat has a velocity of  \u20d7 v A ( t 1 ) =  v A ( t 1 )\u02c6 y . The collision lasts a time  \u2206 t coll . During this time interval, the acrobat grabs the clown. State 2 is immediately after the collision, at a time  t 2 . After the collision, the two people rise together with the same velocity  \u20d7 v A ( t ) =  \u20d7 v C ( t ) =  v AC ( t )\u02c6 y . The key assumption is that the time over which the collision occurs is very short  \u2206 t coll  =  t 2  \u2212 t 1  \u2248 0 . Because the collision is so fast, the impulse delivered by the external gravitational force during the collision is negligibly small. This is the impulse approximation. Because of the impulse approximation, we can say that the total momentum of the system is constant during the collision. If the collision lasts a significant length of time, there would be some slowing down of the acrobat during the collision and we would have to calculate the effect of this. However, by assuming the collision is instantaneous, we can ignore this slowing down and consider the momentum of the system to be conserved. Now let us analyze the time intervals separated by the two states.  Before state 1 , the acrobat is undergoing projectile motion. From one-dimensional kinematics, the vertical component of the position and velocity of 1 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 the acrobat is given by y A ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v A 0 t  +  y A 0  =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t (2) v A ( t ) =  \u2212 gt  +  v A 0  =  \u2212 gt  +  v 0 (3) respectively, where  y A 0  = 0  and  v A 0  =  v 0  are the initial position and velocity of the acrobat as given in the problem. At  t  =  t 1  the acrobat is at height  y ( t 1 ) =  h 0 , so we know y A ( t 1 ) =  h 0  =  \u2212 g 2 t 2 1   +  v 0 t 1 .

Between states 1 and 2 , we know from the impulse approximation that momentum is conserved \u20d7 p sys ( t 1 ) =  \u20d7 p sys ( t 2 ) . (7) Immediately before the collision, the momentum of the acrobat-clown system is only due to acrobat \u20d7 p sys ( t 1 ) =  \u20d7 p A ( t 1 ) +  \u20d7 p C ( t 1 ) =  \u20d7 p A ( t 1 ) =  m A v A ( t 1 )\u02c6 y  =  m A q v 2 0   \u2212 2 gh 0 \u02c6 y, (8) where we have used equation (6). Immediately after the collision, the acrobat and clown are moving together, so the total momentum of the system is \u20d7 p sys ( t 2 ) = ( m A  +  m C ) v AC ( t 2 )\u02c6 y.

Thus, their position and velocity is given by y AC ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 ( t  \u2212 t 2 ) 2  +  v AC 0 ( t  \u2212 t 2 ) +  y AC 0 (11) v AC ( t ) =  \u2212 g ( t  \u2212 t 2 ) +  v AC 0 (12) respectively, where we have offset time such that  y AC 0  =  y AC ( t 2 )  and  v AC 0  =  v AC ( t 2 )  are the position and velocity of the acrobat at  t  =  t 2 . Just after the collision, the acrobat and clown are still at the level of the platform so  y AC 0  =  y AC ( t 2 ) =  h 0 . Substituting this and equation (10) into equations (11) and (12) gives y AC ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 ( t  \u2212 t 2 ) 2  + m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   \u2212 2 gh 0 ( t  \u2212 t 2 ) +  h 0 (13) v AC ( t ) =  \u2212 g ( t  \u2212 t 2 ) + m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   \u2212 2 gh 0 . (14) 2 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 To find the maximum height of their trajectory (at a time we\u2019ll call  t 3 ), we first use equation (14) to find the elapsed time  t 3  \u2212 t 2  at which the velocity is zero v AC ( t 3 ) = 0 =  \u2212 g ( t 3  \u2212 t 2 ) + m A m A  +  m C q v 2 0   \u2212 2 gh 0 \u21d2 t 3  \u2212 t 2  = m A m A  +  m C 1 g q v 2 0   \u2212 2 gh 0 .

What is the terminal speed  v r \u221e of the raindrop? Express your answer in terms of  k  and  g . 1 Momentum and continuous mass transfer", "answer": "1. We start by choosing a coordinate system such that the  \u02c6 y  direction points downwards in the direction of the acceleration due to gravity. Note that the problem is one dimensional. Next, at an arbitrary time  t , we consider a system that is composed of the raindrop of instantaneous mass  m r  and a small differential mass element  \u2206 m c  from the cloud. The raindrop is moving downwards at an instantaneous velocity  v r , while the differential mass element is at rest (since the cloud is stationary). Thus, we can draw the momentum diagram shown below at time  t . A very short time later at  t +\u2206 t , the differential mass element from the cloud has been incorporated into the raindrop. This slightly changes the mass of the raindrop to  m r  + \u2206 m r  as well as the velocity to  v r  + \u2206 v r . This is reflected in the momentum diagram shown below at time  t  + \u2206 t . m r \u0394 m c v r m r  + \u0394 m r v r  + \u0394 v r time  t time  t  + \u0394 t g y From the momentum diagrams, we can use conservation of mass in the system to see that m r  + \u2206 m c  =  m r  + \u2206 m r \u21d2 \u2206 m c  = \u2206 m r , (1) though this will not actually be needed to solve this problem. Additionally, we see that the total momentum of the system at time  t  is \u20d7 p sys ( t ) =  m r v r \u02c6 y  + \u2206 m c (0) =  m r v r \u02c6 y, (2) while at time  t  + \u2206 t  it is \u20d7 p sys ( t  + \u2206 t ) = ( m r  + \u2206 m r )( v r  + \u2206 v r )\u02c6 y. (3) We can now write down the generalized form of Newton\u2019s second law and use the limit form of the time derivative according to \u20d7 F   ext net   =  d\u20d7 p sys dt = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 \u2206 \u20d7 p sys \u2206 t = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 \u20d7 p sys ( t  + \u2206 t )  \u2212 \u20d7 p sys ( t ) \u2206 t . (4) 3 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 If we drew a free body diagram, we\u2019d see that the only external force on the system is gravity  m r g \u02c6 y . Using this and substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (4), we find m r g  = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 ( m r  + \u2206 m r )( v r  + \u2206 v r )  \u2212 m r v r \u2206 t = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 m r \u2206 v r  + \u2206 m r v r  + \u2206 m r \u2206 v r \u2206 t (5) in the  \u02c6 y  direction. We can neglect the final term  \u2206 m r \u2206 v r  in this expression as it is product of two differential elements. Since the differential elements are infinitesimally small, a product of two differential elements will be much smaller than terms that include just one differential element (e.g. \u2206 m r \u2206 v r  \u226a m r \u2206 v r ). Thus, equation (5) becomes m r g  =  m r \u0012 lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 \u2206 v r \u2206 t \u0013 + \u0012 lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 \u2206 m r \u2206 t \u0013 v r . (6) Converting the limits back into derivatives, we find the differential equation m r g  =  m r dv r dt   +  dm r dt  v r . (7) As an aside, note that this is equivalent to the standard generalized Newton\u2019s second law applied to the raindrop alone (i.e.  F   ext net   =  dp r /dt  =  d ( m r v r ) /dt  = ( dm r /dt ) v r   +  m r ( dv r /dt )  using the product rule). This holds because the physical situation corresponds to a category 1 case (as defined in lecture 7a), in which the differential mass element carries no momentum. If the differential element did carry momentum (e.g. problem 4 below), the situation becomes more complicated and using the generalized Newton\u2019s second law for the raindrop alone would no longer be accurate. To find an equation for  v r ( t ) , we can substitute the rate of mass gain from the problem statement into equation (7), dm r dt =  km r v r , (8) which fortunately causes all the factors of  m r  to cancel and gives g  =   dv r dt   +  kv 2 r . (9) This is the differential equation the problem asked for. 2. To calculate the terminal velocity  v \u221e of the raindrop, we could solve the differential equation and then take the limit at  t  \u2192\u221e . However, there is a much easier way. We know that the raindrop will reach terminal velocity only when its acceleration  dv r /dt  = 0  becomes zero. Otherwise the velocity would still be changing with time, so it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cterminal\u201d. Thus, we can use this fact to write equation (9) as g  = 0 +  kv 2 r \u221e (10) and find that v r \u221e = r g k  .

The chain is released and falls onto the scale. What is the force measured by the scale when a length of chain D  has fallen?

We start by taking a coordinate system with  \u02c6 y  pointing downwards in the direction of the acceleration due to gravity and note that the problem is one dimensional. We will let  t  = 0 be the moment that the chain is dropped. Next, we can divide up the chain into many differential elements, each of length  \u2206 y . Then, we will consider the differential element that starts a distance  D  above the scale 4 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 and define its initial position as the origin of our coordinate system. You can\u2019t push with a chain, so there is no force from the ground that is transmitted up the chain to the differential elements still in the air. In other words, each differential element of the chain is in free fall and governed by projectile motion until it makes contact with the scale. Thus, given our coordinate system and the fact that the chain starts at rest, the position and velocity of the differential element follows \u20d7 r ( t ) =  y ( t )\u02c6 y  =  1 2 gt 2 \u02c6 y (1) \u20d7 v ( t ) =  v y ( t )\u02c6 y  =  gt \u02c6 y (2) respectively. Using equation (1), we can calculate the time  t  just before the differential element of interest makes contact with the scale to be y ( t ) =  D  =  1 2 gt 2 \u21d2 t  = s 2 D g  . (3) Substituting this into equation (2), we see that the element is traveling with a velocity of \u20d7 v ( t ) =  v y ( t )\u02c6 y  =  g s 2 D g   \u02c6 y  = p 2 gD \u02c6 y (4) just before it impacts the scale. A very short time later  t  + \u2206 t , the differential element is at rest on the scale. We can calculate the force required to cause this through the change in momentum of the differential element. First, we need the mass \u2206 m . We have choosen to divide up the rope into differential elements of length  \u2206 y . Thus, given that the linear mass density  \u03bb  of the chain is uniform, we can find the mass according to \u03bb  =   M L   = \u2206 m \u2206 y \u21d2 \u2206 m  =   M L   \u2206 y. (5) We can now define a system composed of exclusively the differential element of interest and draw momentum diagrams at time  t  and  t  + \u2206 t  (see below). Using equations (4) and (5), the momentum of such a system at time  t  is \u20d7 p sys ( t ) = \u2206 m\u20d7 v ( t ) = \u0012 M L   \u2206 y \u0013 \u0010p 2 gD \u02c6 y \u0011 = p 2 gD M L   \u2206 y \u02c6 y, (6) while at  t  + \u2206 t  the total momentum is \u20d7 p sys ( t  + \u2206 t ) = \u2206 m (0) = 0 .

(8) 5 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 The external force will be only the normal force from the scale on the differential element \u20d7 F   ext net   =  \u2212 F scale \u02c6 y, (9) which is what we are interested in calculating to determine the reading on the scale. This is because the gravitational force can be neglected through the impulse approximation, since the time interval  \u2206 t  is so short. Substituting equations (6), (7) and (9) into equation (8), we find \u2212 F scale  = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 0  \u2212 \u221a 2 gD ( M/L )\u2206 y \u2206 t =  \u2212 p 2 gD M L \u0012 lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 \u2206 y \u2206 t \u0013 (10) in the  \u02c6 y  direction. Converting the limit back into a derivative gives F scale  = p 2 gD M L dy dt  . (11) Using the definition of velocity as the derivative of position  v y  =  dy/dt  and making use of equation (4) gives F scale  = p 2 gD M L  v y  = p 2 gD M L \u0010p 2 gD \u0011 = 2 gD M L  , (12) the magnitude of the upwards force exerted by the scale on the differential element of the chain. If we drew a free body diagram for the scale at time  t  + \u2206 t , we would see that there are two forces from the chain acting on it: the normal force from the differential element that just impacted the scale and the normal force from the part of the chain that is already sitting stationary on the scale. The length of chain already on the scale is  D , so we can use the linear density to find its mass to be  m  =  \u03bbD  =  D ( M/L ) . Thus, the part of the chain sitting on the scale exerts a downward force with a magnitude of  mg  =  D ( M/L ) g . Adding this to the action-reaction pair of equation (12) gives a total downwards force of the chain on the scale of Scale reading  =  D M L  g  + 2 gDM L   = 3 gDM L  . (13) This is our final answer for the reading on the scale. Note that since  D  was an arbitrary location, we can use equation (3) to replace  D  in equation (13) with  t . This allows us to see how the scale reading depends on time Scale reading  =  3 2 M L  g 2 t 2 . (14) Thus, the scale reading increases quadratically with time. The top end of the chain will land on the scale when  D  =  L , at which time equation (13) becomes Scale reading  = 3 Mg. (15) In other words, the maximum reading of the scale is three times the mass of the rope. Of course, after the entire chain has come to rest, the reading on the scale will drop to the weight of the chain, i.e. Scale reading  =  Mg.

The instantaneous speed of the rocket is  v r , so we can draw the momentum diagram shown below at time  t . A very short time later at t  + \u2206 t , the rocket has ejected a differential mass element  \u2206 m f  of fuel, which slightly alters the mass of the rocket to  m r  + \u2206 m r . Note that it is important allow an arbitrary change in the rocket\u2019s mass by  +\u2206 m r . This will help to prevent sign errors later in the derivation (e.g. accidentally accounting for the fact that the rocket\u2019s mass is decreasing twice) and accommodate more general calculations where the mass is changing due to several mechanisms.

(4) If we drew a free body diagram, we\u2019d see that the only external force on the system is gravity   \u20d7 F   ext net   =  \u2212 m r g \u02c6 y . Using this and substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (4), we find \u2212 m r g  = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 ( m r  + \u2206 m r )( v r  + \u2206 v r )  \u2212 \u2206 m r ( v r  \u2212 u )  \u2212 m r v r \u2206 t = lim \u2206 t \u2192 0 m r \u2206 v r  + \u2206 m r \u2206 v r  + \u2206 m r u \u2206 t (5) in the  \u02c6 y  direction. We can neglect the  \u2206 m r \u2206 v r  term in this expression as it is product of two differential elements. Since the differential elements are infinitesimally small, a product of two differential elements will be much smaller than terms that include just one differential element (e.g.  \u2206 m r \u2206 v r  \u226a m r \u2206 v r ).

(7) Now, as in problem 2, we must determine  dm r /dt , the rate of change of the mass of the rocket (including the fuel it contains). We know that, at take-off when  t  = 0 , the total mass of the rocket and fuel is  M . Additionally, it ejects fuel at a constant rate of  D . Thus, the total mass of the rocket as a function of time is m r ( t ) =  M  \u2212 Dt, (8) which gives dm r dt =  \u2212 D (9) after taking a derivative. Substituting this result into equation (7) gives the differential equation \u2212 m r g  =  m r dv r dt   \u2212 Du. (10) Rearranging and using equation (8) gives dv r dt   =  \u2212 g  + Du M  \u2212 Dt . (11) The problem statement ultimately asks us to find the speed and altitude of the rocket. Thus, we will integrate equation (11) to find the velocity v r ( t ) =  \u2212 Z gdt  + Z Du M  \u2212 Dt dt. (12) The first integral is straightforward, but to accomplish the second we must perform a change of variables. We know the integral of  1 /x 1  is the natural logarithm, so we will let x 1  =  M  \u2212 Dt (13) and rewrite v r ( t ) =  \u2212 Z gdt  +  Du Z 1 x 1 dt dx 1 dx 1 . (14) Solving equation (13) for  t  =  M/D  \u2212 x 1 /D  and taking a derivative gives  dt/dx 1  =  \u2212 1 /D . Substituting this, taking the integrals, and using equation (13) gives v r ( t ) =  \u2212 Z gdt  +  Du Z 1 x 1 \u0012 \u2212 1 D \u0013 dx 1  =  \u2212 gt  \u2212 u  ln( x 1 ) +  C 1  =  \u2212 gt  \u2212 u  ln( M  \u2212 Dt ) +  C 1 , (15) where  C 1  is a constant of integration. It can be determined by using the initial condition that the rocket is at rest at  t  = 0 , i.e.  v r (0) = 0 . This gives v r (0) = 0 =  \u2212 u  ln( M ) +  C 1 \u21d2 C 1  =  u  ln( M ) . (16) Substituting this into equation (15) and using the property of logarithms that  ln( A ) \u2212 ln( B ) = ln( A/B )  gives v r ( t ) =  \u2212 gt  \u2212 u  ln( M  \u2212 Dt ) +  u  ln( M ) =  \u2212 gt  \u2212 u  ln \u0012 M  \u2212 Dt M \u0013 . (17) To find the altitude of the rocket, we must integrate once more in time to find the position y r ( t ) =  \u2212 Z gtdt  \u2212 u Z ln \u0012 M  \u2212 Dt M \u0013 dt. (18) 8 Momentum and continuous mass transfer - 7 Again the first integral is straightforward, but the second is challenging. We can use the second hint in the problem statement if we first perform a change of variables to x 2  =   M  \u2212 Dt M . (19) This allows us to write equation (18) as y r ( t ) =  \u2212 Z gtdt  \u2212 u Z ln ( x 2 )   dt dx 2 dx 2 . (20) Solving equation (19) for  t  =  \u2212 M/D ( x 2  \u2212 1)  and taking a derivative gives  dt/dx 2  =  \u2212 M/D . Substituting this, taking the integrals via hint 2, and using equation (19) gives y r ( t ) =  \u2212 Z gtdt  \u2212 u Z ln ( x 2 ) \u0012 \u2212 M D \u0013 dx 2  =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  Mu D  x 2  (ln( x 2 )  \u2212 1) +  C 2 (21) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  Mu D M  \u2212 Dt M \u0012 ln \u0012 M  \u2212 Dt M \u0013 \u2212 1 \u0013 +  C 2  =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  uM  \u2212 Dt D \u0012 ln \u0012 M  \u2212 Dt M \u0013 \u2212 1 \u0013 +  C 2 , (22) where  C 2  is an integration constant. It can be determined by using the initial condition that the rocket starts on the ground at  t  = 0 , i.e.  y r (0) = 0 . This gives y r (0) = 0 =  u M D   (ln (1)  \u2212 1) +  C 2 \u21d2 C 2  =  \u2212 u M D   ( \u2212 1) =  uM D  .

The ball is thrown straight up, so normally its motion would be one-dimensional, along the  y - axis.

To calculate the net work done on the body, we first need to identify the forces applied. We start by defining a cylindrical coordinate system with the origin located at the fixed ring in the center of the circular motion. We are told that the string is pulled downward with constant velocity, so the body moves inward with  \u02d9 \u03c1  =  \u2212 V  =  constant and \u00a8 \u03c1  = 0 .

We start by defining a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at the cannon, a vertical axis  z pointing upwards, and a horizontal axis  x  such that it contains the horizontal component of  \u20d7 v 0 . The projectile undergoes motion under a constant acceleration of  \u20d7 g  =  \u2212 g \u02c6 z , so its vertical velocity and position are given by v z ( t ) =  \u2212 gt  +  v 0  sin  \u03b1 (1) z ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v 0 t  sin  \u03b1 (2) respectively, where we have used the initial conditions that  v z (0) =  v 0  sin  \u03b1  and  z (0) = 0 . The peak of the trajectory is reached when  v z ( t e ) = 0 , so we can use equation (1) to find the time of the explosion t e  to be v z ( t e ) = 0 =  \u2212 gt e  +  v 0  sin  \u03b1 \u21d2 t e  =   v 0  sin  \u03b1 g . (3) At what time do the pieces hit the ground? From equations (2) and (3), we see that the vertical position of the projectile at the time of the explosion is z ( t e ) =  z e  =  \u2212 g 2 \u0012 v 0  sin  \u03b1 g \u0013 2 +  v 0 \u0012 v 0  sin  \u03b1 g \u0013 sin  \u03b1  =  ( v 0  sin  \u03b1 ) 2 2 g . (4) At this time, the projectile explodes into a thousand pieces, which each still undergo projectile motion. Thus, their height evolves according to z ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 ( t  \u2212 t e ) 2  +  z e (5) because their vertical velocity is  v z ( t e ) = 0  and their position is  z ( t e ) =  z e  at time  t  =  t e . From this we can calculate the time  t g  at which they hit the ground  z ( t g ) = 0  to be z ( t g ) = 0 =  \u2212 g 2 ( t g  \u2212 t e ) 2  +  z e \u21d2 t g  =  t e  + r 2 z e g  . (6) 3 Work and energy - 8 Substituting equations (3) and (4) gives t g  =   v 0  sin  \u03b1 g + s 2 g ( v 0  sin  \u03b1 ) 2 2 g = 2 v 0  sin  \u03b1 g . (7) This is a sensible result as the fragments all have zero vertical velocity just before and just after the explosion. Thus, it will take them the same amount of time to fall to the ground as it did for them to ascend. Thus, we\u2019d expect  t g  = 2 t e , which we see is the case by comparing equations (3) and (7). Why do they all hit the ground at the same time? Just before the explosion, the projectile has a purely horizontal velocity (since it is at the peak of its trajectory). As a result of the explosion, the fragments don\u2019t gain any vertical velocity because their velocity relative to the original projectile is purely horizontal. Thus, their velocities relative to the ground are also horizontal just after time  t e . This means that the pieces all have the same height and vertical velocity at  t e . Because gravity accelerates objects the same regardless of mass, they all hit the ground at the same time. 2.  The pieces land on the ground in a circle. Why? Given that we know the time at which the fragments hit the ground, in this part of the problem we will only consider the horizontal motion of the objects and ignore the vertical motion. It is not needed. First, we view the dynamics from the frame of reference moving with the horizontal location of the center of mass of the system (i.e. the projectile). In this frame, we will use cylindrical coordinates with the origin defined to be the ground directly below the location of the center of mass. Immediately after the explosion, all the pieces have the same speed  u  with respect to the origin of our moving frame and are moving purely horizontally. This means their velocity is entirely in the outwards radial direction. In this direction, they experience no acceleration, so their horizontal velocity and position are given by v \u03c1 ( t ) =  u (8) \u03c1 ( t ) =  u ( t  \u2212 t e ) (9) for any time  t > t e . Here we used the fact that at  t  =  t e  the horizontal position of every piece is at the origin and the initial velocity is  u . Thus, after a time interval  t  \u2212 t e  the pieces lie on a circle with radius  u ( t  \u2212 t e )  centered around the origin of the moving center of mass frame. To see what shape they make when they land on the ground, we need to convert to the stationary frame of the ground. To do so, we use equations (8) and (9) and the formulas to convert between references frames to write \u20d7 v i ( t ) =   \u20d7 V CM ( t ) +  u \u02c6 r i (10) \u20d7 r i ( t ) =   \u20d7 R CM ( t ) +  u ( t  \u2212 t e )\u02c6 r i , (11) where  \u20d7 v i ( t )  and  \u20d7 r i ( t )  are the horizontal velocity and position of the  i th   fragment in the ground reference frame,   \u20d7 V CM ( t )  and   \u20d7 R CM ( t )  are the horizontal velocity and position of the origin of the center of mass frame, and  \u02c6 r i  is the radial unit vector pointing at the  i th   fragment from the origin of the center of mass frame. Due to the fact that there is no net external horizontal force on the system, the horizontal momentum of the projectile does not change. Thus,   \u20d7 V CM ( t )  is a constant and equal to its initial value when the projectile is launched   \u20d7 V CM ( t ) =  v 0  cos  \u03b1 \u02c6 x . This implies that the center of mass position is   \u20d7 R CM ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  \u03b1 \u02c6 x  because the center of mass position at  t  = 0  is at the origin in the ground reference frame (i.e. the integration constant that arises in going from velocity to position is zero). Plugging this result into equation (11), we see that \u20d7 r i ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  \u03b1 \u02c6 x  +  u ( t  \u2212 t e )\u02c6 r i (12) 4 Work and energy - 8 at any time  t > t e . The last term tell us that, in the center of mass reference frame, all the pieces are flying apart outwards from each other with the same speed  u , but in different directions  \u02c6 r i . Thus, they form a circle of radius R ( t ) =  u ( t  \u2212 t e ) . (13) The first term on the right side of equation (12) tells us how this motion changes when we convert to the reference frame of the ground. Since the subscript  i  doesn\u2019t appear, we know that this term is the same for all fragments. Specifically, all fragments are moving together in the  \u02c6 x  direction with time. This corresponds to a displacement in the center of the circle by \u20d7 d ( t ) =  v 0 t  cos  \u03b1 \u02c6 x. (14) However, since all pieces are moving together, it doesn\u2019t change the shape from being circular. In conclusion, in the reference frame of the ground the pieces form a circle that shifts in the  \u02c6 x  direction with time. What is the distance between the center of the circle and the cannon? This can be found by taking the magnitude of equation (14) at the time when the fragments hit the ground  t  =  t g  using equation (7), giving d ( t g ) = 2 v 2 0 g   sin  \u03b1  cos  \u03b1. (15) This is the same location that the projectile would have hit had it not exploded. Calculate the speed  u  and then the radius of the circle. To calculate  u  it is most convienant to return the reference frame moving with the horizontal location of the center of mass of the system. Just before the explosion the total kinetic energy of the system is zero as there is no vertical motion and we are in a reference frame moving with the horizontal motion of the projectile. From the problem statement, we know that just after the explosion the kinetic energy of the system increases by  W . This must be contained in the speed  u  possessed by each of the 1000 fragments. Using this we can calculate  u  to be W  = 1000 X i =1 K i  = 1000 X i =1 1 2 m i u 2  = 1 2 u 2 1000 X i =1 m i  =  1 2 u 2 M \u21d2 u  = r 2 W M  . (16) To find the radius of the circle we evaluate equation (13) at the time when the fragments hit the ground t  =  t g  and substitute equations (3), (7), and (16). This gives R ( t g ) = r 2 W M v 0 g   sin  \u03b1. (17) 3. If a fragment hits the cannon, then we know the radius of the circle must be equal to the distance between the cannon and the center of the circle at  t  =  t g , R ( t g ) =  d ( t g ) . (18) Substituting equations (15) and (17) gives r 2 W M v 0 g   sin  \u03b1  = 2 v 2 0 g   sin  \u03b1  cos  \u03b1 \u21d2 W  = 2 Mv 2 0   cos 2  \u03b1 \u21d2 W  = 4 K 0  cos 2   \u03b1 (19) as the initial kinetic energy of the projectile is  K 0  =  Mv 2 0 / 2 . 5 Work and energy - 8 ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "An object of mass  m  is released from rest and is pushed by a spring (with a spring constant  k ) that has been compressed by a distance  x 0 .

The work-kinetic energy theorem tells us that the work done by the net force on the object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. So let\u2019s take the initial state to be when the spring is compressed by a distance  x 0  and the final state to be when the object is at its maximum height. In both of these states, the velocity is equal to zero, so the kinetic energy is zero as well. Thus, as a consequence of the work-kinetic energy theorem, we know that the total work done on the object during its path must be equal to zero. We choose the positive  \u02c6 x  direction to point to the left since it is the direction of motion. The motion has four stages and we need to calculate the work on the object during each: 1.

(2) 3. The work done by the normal force of the surface of the loop is zero because the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface and the object is always moving along the surface. Thus, the normal force is perpendicular to the trajectory, so the dot product of the force and the displacement is zero. 4. Using the form of the gravitational force, we can calculate the work done by gravity as the object moves to a height  h  to be W grav  =  \u2212 Z  h 0 F grav dy  =  \u2212 Z  h 0 ( mg ) dy  =  \u2212 mgh.

Using the form of the friction force and equation (2), we find F f  =  \u00b5 k N  =  \u00b5 k mg  cos  \u03b8. (3) This allows us to calculate the total work done by friction to be W f  = Z  d 0 \u20d7 F f  \u00b7  \u02c6 xdx  =  \u2212 Z  d 0 F f dx  =  \u2212 F f d  =  \u2212 \u00b5 k mgd  cos  \u03b8. (4) Plugging in the numerical values, we find W f  =  \u2212 (0 . 2)(20  kg )(9 . 8  m / s 2 )(5  m )(cos(20 \u25e6 )) =  \u2212 180  J . (5) 2. In this part, we will calculate the total work performed on the child and then use the work-kinetic energy theorem to determine the kinetic energy, which allows us to find the final speed. We already know the work done by friction from part 1. The only other force in the problem is gravity, for which we can calculate the work as W g  = Z  0 h 0 \u20d7 F g  \u00b7  \u02c6 ydy  = Z  0 h 0 ( \u2212 mg \u02c6 y )  \u00b7  \u02c6 ydy  = Z  h 0 0 mg \u02c6 y  \u00b7  \u02c6 ydy  =  mg ( h 0  \u2212 0) =  mg ( d  sin  \u03b8 ) =  mgd  sin  \u03b8,  (6) where we have adopted a new coordinate system with  \u02c6 y  pointing straight upwards and note that the child is traveling  from  a height  h 0  to  a height  0 . We also used trigonometry to calculate the height of the slide  h 0  =  d  sin  \u03b8  in terms of known quantities. Thus, the total work performed on the child is W  =  W f  +  W g  =  \u2212 \u00b5 k mgd  cos  \u03b8  +  mgd  sin  \u03b8. (7) By the work-kinetic energy theorem, this work must be equal to the change in kinetic energy according to W  = \u2206 K  =  K f  \u2212 K i . (8) Since the child starts at rest, the initial kinetic energy is K i  = 0 . (9) 7 Work and energy - 8 At the bottom, they are moving at some speed  v f  (which we want to calculate), so K f  =  1 2 mv 2 f . (10) Plugging equations (7), (9), and (10) into equation (8) gives \u2212 \u00b5 k mgd  cos  \u03b8  +  mgd  sin  \u03b8  =  1 2 mv 2 f   \u2212 0 . (11) We can solve this to find that the speed of the child at the bottom of the slide is v f  = p 2 gd  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 ) . (12) Plugging in the numbers gives v f  = p 2(9 . 8  m / s 2 )(5 . 0  m )(sin(20 \u25e6 )  \u2212 (0 . 2) cos(20 \u25e6 )) = 3 . 9  m / s . (13) 3. To calculate the time it takes for the child to slide down the slide, we use Newton\u2019s second law in the \u02c6 x  direction (in the coordinate system of part 1). Substituting equation (3) into equation (1) gives a x ( t ) =  g  sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k g  cos  \u03b8  =  g  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 )  . (14) Integrating this once in time yields the velocity v x ( t ) =  gt  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 )  , (15) where the integration constant is zero because the child starts at rest. Since we know the final speed from part 2, we can use it to calculate the final time  t f  as v x ( t f ) =  v f  =  gt f  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 ) \u21d2 t f  = v f g  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 ) . (16) Substituting equation (12) gives t f  = p 2 gd  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 ) g  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 ) = s 2 d g  (sin  \u03b8  \u2212 \u00b5 k  cos  \u03b8 ) . (17) Plugging in the numbers, we find t f  = s 2(5 . 0  m ) (9 . 8  m / s 2 )(sin(20 \u25e6 )  \u2212 (0 . 2) cos(20 \u25e6 ))  = 2 . 6  s . (18) 4. Since we can assume that the children start and finish at rest, by the work-kinetic energy theorem we know that the total work must be zero. As a child ascends, it experiences two forces. The normal force from the ladder, which the child uses to push itself up, and the gravitational force, which is pulling downwards on the child. Thus, we have W  =  W g  +  W N  = \u2206 K  = 0 , (19) where we note that  W N  represents the work done by the child via the normal force. Defining a coordinate system with the origin at the ground and the  \u02c6 y  direction pointing upwards, we see that the work done by gravity as the child ascends is W g  = Z  h 0 0 \u20d7 F g  \u00b7  \u02c6 ydy  = Z  h 0 0 ( \u2212 mg \u02c6 y )  \u00b7  \u02c6 ydy  =  \u2212 mgh 0 . (20) Substituting this into equation (19) allows us to calculate the work done by the child W N  =  mgh 0 . (21) We see that this doesn\u2019t depend on time, only on the mass of the child. Since the two children have equal masses, they do the same amount of work. 8 ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "A small block of mass  m  is pushed against a spring with spring constant  k  and is held in place with a latch.

What was the original distance  x  that the spring was compressed by? ", "answer": "1. As the block is initially at rest  v 0  = 0 , the initial kinetic energy before the latch is released is  K 0  = mv 2 0 / 2 = 0 . The initial potential energy of the compression of the spring is given by  U s 0   =  kx 2 / 2 . We will define the origin of our coordinate system to be at the height of the horizontal track, so the initial height of the block is  y 0  = 0  and the initial gravitational potential energy is  U g 0  =  mgy 0  = 0 . Therefore, the total initial energy is E 0  =  K 0  +  U s 0  +  U g 0  = 0 +   k 2 x 2  + 0 =  k 2 x 2 . (1) At the top of the loop  y t  = 2 R , the kinetic energy is  K t  =  mv 2 t   / 2 , the gravitational potential energy is  U gt  =  mgy t  = 2 mgR , and the spring is no longer in contact with the block so  U st  = 0 . Thus, the total energy at the top of the loop is given by E t  =  K t  +  U st  +  U gt  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 0 + 2 mgR  =  m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (2) Since the track is frictionless and there is no air drag, mechanical energy is conserved and we can use equations (1) and (2) to write E 0  =  E t \u21d2 k 2 x 2  =  m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR \u21d2 K t  =   m 2   v 2 t   =  k 2 x 2  \u2212 2 mgR. (3) 2. From Newton\u2019s second law and the properties of uniform circular motion, we know that the net force in the radial direction is equal to the centripetal force.

Choosing to use a spherical coordinate system, the change in the potential energy due to the force   \u20d7 F is \u2206 U  =  U ( R )  \u2212 U ( \u221e ) =  \u2212 Z C \u20d7 F  \u00b7  d \u20d7 l  =  \u2212 Z C \u0012 \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 r 2 +   C r 3 \u0013 \u02c6 r  \u00b7 \u0010 dr \u02c6 r  +  rd\u03b8 \u02c6 \u03b8  +  r  sin  \u03b8d\u03d5 \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 = Z C \u0012 Gm 1 m 2 r 2 \u2212 C r 3 \u0013 dr, (1) where the integration path  C  is along the trajectory from  r  =  \u221e to  r  =  R . However, we see that, since the force is purely radial, only the change in the radial position matters. Thus, we can write \u2206 U  =  U ( R )  \u2212 U ( \u221e ) = Z  R \u221e Gm 1 m 2 r 2 \u2212 C r 3  dr.

(3) Since the reference point for the potential energy is at  r  =  \u221e (i.e. we define the potential energy such that  U ( \u221e ) = 0 ), equation (3) implies that U ( R ) =  \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 R + C 2 R 2  , (4) which will be useful in the next part of the problem. 2.

(5) Solving for  R 0  shows that there is just one equilibrium point at R 0  = C Gm 1 m 2 .

As the block is initially at rest  v 0  = 0 , the initial kinetic energy is K 0  =  mv 2 0 / 2 = 0 . The initial potential energy is due to gravity. We will define the reference point to be at the height of the table, so the initial height of the object is  y 0  =  h  and the initial gravitational potential energy is  U g 0  =  mgh . Therefore, the total initial energy is E 0  =  K 0  +  U g 0  = 0 +  mgh  =  mgh. (1) At the top of the loop  y t  = 2 R , the kinetic energy is  K t  =  mv 2 t   / 2  and the gravitational potential energy is U gt  =  mgy t  = 2 mgR .

In method 1, we will use differential elements. To calculate the tension, we start by considering a small piece of rope with length  \u2206 x  and its left end located at an arbitrary position  x  along the rope. Here we define a coordinate system where  x  = 0  is the location at which the rope connects to the block and \u02c6 x  points to the right. Since the rope has a uniform linear mass density  \u03bb , we can calculate the mass of the differential element  \u2206 m  to be \u03bb  =   M L   = \u2206 m \u2206 x \u21d2 \u2206 m  =   M L   \u2206 x.

(3) Taking the limit that the differential element is infinitesimally small  \u2206 x  \u2192 0  produces the differential equation dT dx   =  M L  a r .

Thus, we can directly integrate equation (4) to find T ( x ) =   M L  ax  +  C, (5) where  C  is an integration constant. To find the value of  C  we must apply a boundary condition. We can  either  use  T ( L ) =  F a  or find a condition on  T (0)  by analyzing the block. The first is quicker and allows us to directly calculate T ( L ) =  F a  =   M L  aL  +  C \u21d2 C  =  F a  \u2212 Ma (6) from equation (5). The second is more work.

The purpose was to evaluate this as a method of planetary defense (i.e. to prevent future asteroids from hitting Earth). We are going to study some aspects of this mission. The system chosen for the DART mission is a double asteroid. It is composed of a main object Didymos (called D1) and a second smaller object Dimorphos (called D2). D1 has a spherical shape, a radius of  r 1 , and an unknown mass  m 1 . D2 has a spherical shape, a radius of  r 2 , and an unknown mass  m 2 . D2 orbits around D1 in a circular trajectory with a radius of  R 0  and a period of  T 0 . The quantities  r 1 ,  r 2 ,  R 0 , and  T 0  are all known values (as they have been measured from Earth by radar), but  m 1  and  m 2  are initially unknown. We know the value of the universal gravitational constant  G and will perform most of the calculations in the reference frame of D1 (i.e. the origin  O  is at the center of D1) given the cylindrical coordinate system shown in the figure below.

We know both the radius  R 0  and the period  T 0  of the circular orbit that D2 is executing about D1. Thus, D2 travels once around D1 in a time  T 0  and travels a total distance of  2 \u03c0R 0 . This means its average speed is v 0  =  2 \u03c0R 0 T 0 . (1) Since there are no other forces in the problem, D2 must be executing uniform circular motion, so its average speed is identical to its instantaneous speed v 0  =  2 \u03c0R 0 T 0 .

Calculate the tension in the rope  T ( \u03c1 ) as a function of  \u03c1  (the radial distance from the pivot point  O p ) as well as  \u03d5  (the angle of the rope) and  \u03c9  (the instantaneous angular speed of the rope). Note that in this part you may assume the  tension is zero at the end of the rope and include the variables  \u03c1 ,  \u03d5 , and  \u03c9  in your answer.

Note that in this part you may assume the  tension is zero at the end of the rope  and include the variables  \u03c1 ,  \u03d5 , and  \u03c9  in your answer. To calculate the tension in a massive rope, we start by dividing it into differential elements and then draw the free body diagram for an arbitrary element in the middle (shown above). We will draw it at an arbitrary angular position  \u03d5 . From this we see that there are three forces acting on the differential element: gravity (\u2206 mg ), the tension force from the differential element above ( T 1 ), and the tension force from the differential element below ( T 2 ). To find how the tension changes with location, we only need to consider the forces acting  along  the rope, which is in the \u02c6 \u03c1  direction. Thus, from our free body diagram, we see that the radial component of Newton\u2019s second law is T 2  \u2212 T 1  + \u2206 mg  cos  \u03d5  = \u2206 ma \u03c1 , (1) where  a \u03c1  is the radial component of the acceleration of the differential element. Since the rope stays straight and simply pivots around the point  O p , it is executing circular motion (though the circular motion is not uniform as  \u03c9  is changing). We know that the radial component of the acceleration of an object executing circular motion is the centripetal acceleration  \u20d7 a cent  = \u2212 \u03c1\u03c9 2 \u02c6 \u03c1 , where  \u03c1  is the radial location of the differential element that we are considering. We can substitute this to find \u2206 T  + \u2206 mg  cos  \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u2206 m\u03c1\u03c9 2 , (2) where we have identified the change in tension across the differential element as \u2206 T  =  T 2  \u2212 T 1 . Note that there will also be a tangential component of the acceleration  a \u03d5  as the rope is experiencing angular acceleration due to gravity, but this does not appear in the  radial  component of Newton\u2019s second law. Next, we can use the density to convert the differential mass to a differential length. Since the rope has a uniform linear mass density, we know that \u03bb  =   m \u2113 = \u2206 m \u2206 \u03c1 \u21d2 \u2206 m  =   m \u2113 \u2206 \u03c1.

You throw the axe at the target, releasing it such that its center of mass has a horizontal velocity of  v xi  and a vertical velocity of  v yi .

The axe exhibits two types of motion as it moves through the air: translation of its center of mass and rotation about its center of mass. Since the only force acting on the axe is gravity, the center of mass follows ballistic motion. Thus, as in problem 2.a, we can immediately write down the expressions for the horizontal and vertical positions of the center of mass, which are x CM ( t ) =  v xi t  +  x i (1) y CM ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v yi t  +  y i (2) respectively. Note that, because  \u02c6 y  points upwards in this problem, the gravitational term needs to have a negative sign. The coordinate system is defined such that  x i  = 0  and  y i  = 0 , so we find x CM ( t ) =  v xi t (3) y CM ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v yi t. (4) Next we must calculate the effect of the rotational motion. First, we must determine the location of center of mass along the handle, to see how far it is from the blade. We will define new coordinate  s , which has its origin at the location of the blade and increases as you move along the handle. In this coordinate system, we know that the center of mass of the handle on its own is at  s h  = 2 \u2113 . This is because the handle is uniform and symmetric, so we know that it is midway along its length and the handle is  4 \u2113 long. Since we can model the blade as a point mass, its center of mass is at its location of s b  = 0 . Thus, the center of mass of the entire axe (i.e. handle and blade together) is a distance of s CM  = P i   m i s i P i   m i =   ms h  +  ms b m  +  m =  \u2113 (5) away from the blade. Since there is no air resistance, while the axe is flying through the air, it experiences no torque. This means the blade of the axe undergoes uniform circular motion with its initial angular velocity of  \u03c9 i \u02c6 z at a radius of  \u03c1  =  s CM  =  \u2113 away from the center of mass. Given such uniform circular motion, we know that the velocity of the blade of the axe around the center of mass is \u20d7 v b  =  v \u03d5   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2113\u03c9 i   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2113\u03c9 i  ( \u2212 sin  \u03d5 \u02c6 x  + cos  \u03d5 \u02c6 y )  , (6) where we have used the cylindrical coordinate unit vector to Cartesian coordinates using the relation \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 sin  \u03d5 \u02c6 x +cos  \u03d5 \u02c6 y . We need to perform this conversion because the problem asks us for the position in Cartesian coordinates. We want to find the position, so, since velocity is the derivative of position, we can write d\u20d7 r b dt   =  \u2113\u03c9 i  ( \u2212 sin ( \u03d5 ( t )) \u02c6 x  + cos ( \u03d5 ( t )) \u02c6 y )  . (7) We would like to integrate this, but one subtlety, which we have made explicit in this formula, is that the angular position  \u03d5 ( t )  is changing with time. To determine how it varies, we remember that the angular velocity is constant  \u03c9 ( t ) =  \u03c9 i  and that  \u03c9 ( t ) =  d\u03d5/dt . Combining these two relationships and integrating once in time gives  \u03d5 ( t ) =  \u03c9 i t  +  C . Since the initial condition for the angular position is \u03d5 (0) =  \u03c0/ 2 , we see that  C  =  \u03c0/ 2  and the angular position varies with time according to \u03d5 ( t ) =  \u03c9 i t  +   \u03c0 2   . (8) 12 19 January 2024 - Solution to the Final Exam Substituting this into equation (7) gives d\u20d7 r b dt   =  \u2113\u03c9 i \u0010 \u2212 sin \u0010 \u03c9 i t  +   \u03c0 2 \u0011 \u02c6 x  + cos \u0010 \u03c9 i t  +   \u03c0 2 \u0011 \u02c6 y \u0011 =  \u2212 \u2113\u03c9 i  (cos ( \u03c9 i t ) \u02c6 x  + sin ( \u03c9 i t ) \u02c6 y )  , (9) where we have made use of the identities given in the question. Now we can directly integrate this expression to find \u20d7 r b ( t ) =  \u2212 \u2113 sin ( \u03c9 i t ) \u02c6 x  +  \u2113 cos ( \u03c9 i t ) \u02c6 y  +   \u20d7 C, (10) where   \u20d7 C  is a constant that is a vector (since the equation is a vector equation). To determine it we use the initial condition that the blade is above the center of mass and a distance of  \u2113 away, so  \u20d7 r b (0) =  \u2113 \u02c6 y . Applying this initial condition we see that   \u20d7 C  = 0 , so equation (10) becomes \u20d7 r b ( t ) =  \u2212 \u2113 sin ( \u03c9 i t ) \u02c6 x  +  \u2113 cos ( \u03c9 i t ) \u02c6 y, (11) which is the position of the blade relative to the center of mass. Lastly, we must combine the translational motion (given by equations (3) and (4)) and rotational motion (given by equation (11)) to find the motion of the blade in the laboratory coordinate system defined in the problem statement. This can be accomplished by vector addition as equations (3) and (4) give the position of the center of mass in the laboratory frame and equation (11) gives the position of the blade relative to the center of mass. Thus, we sum the components of equation (11) with equations (3) and (4) to find the final answer x b ( t ) =  v xi t  \u2212 \u2113 sin ( \u03c9 i t ) (12) y b ( t ) =  \u2212 g 2 t 2  +  v yi t  +  \u2113 cos ( \u03c9 i t )  .

For  k  = 1 we get a training error of 0. NOTE: Training error refers to the error you get if you apply the learned function on the training data. Hence it is irrelevant that  k -nearest neighbor does not have a traditional \u201ctraining\u201d phase. 2. If we are using relatively large values of  k  the model will become very simple (constant once we choose  k  close to  N ) and we will severly under\ufb01t. 3. The best choice is  k  = 5 or  k  = 7 (assuming that we choose it odd). For this choice we will make a mistake for the 4 points at the extreme boundary and will get the correct prediction for the 10 points closer to the center. Hence the error is 2 / 7. 4. See the plot. Many people got the regions approximately right but not exactly right. The regions are piece-wise linear. Many people more or less solved this problem correctly. Almost nobody got the region in point 4 exactly right but we deduced only few points in this case if any. y y y y Page 22 / 29 3941009 \u2013 I Know All y y y y Page 23 / 29 3941009 \u2013 I Know All y y y y", "course": "ML"}, {"question": " In the following let  \u03ba 1 ( x ,  x \u2032 ) and  \u03ba 2 ( x ,  x \u2032 ) be two valid kernels.

Hence, \u03ba ( x ,  x \u2032 ) =  a\u03c6 1 ( x ) \u22a4 \u03c6 1 ( x \u2032 ) +  b\u03c6 2 ( x ) \u22a4 \u03c6 2 ( x \u2032 ) . This can be represented as an inner product via the feature map ( \u221a a\u03c6 1 ( \u00b7 ) , \u221a b\u03c6 2 ( \u00b7 )) . 2. Let the two feature maps be  \u03c6 1  and  \u03c6 2 . Assume that they are of dimensions  d 1  and  d 2 . Then  \u03c6  is a feature map of dimension  d 1 d 2  of the form \u03c6 ( x ) \u22a4 =(( \u03c6 1 ( x )) 1 ( \u03c6 2 ( x )) 1 ,  \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  ,  ( \u03c6 1 ( x )) 1 ( \u03c6 2 ( x )) d 2 ,  \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  , ( \u03c6 1 ( x )) d 1 ( \u03c6 2 ( x )) 1 ,  \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7  ,  ( \u03c6 1 ( x )) d 1 ( \u03c6 2 ( x )) d 2 ) . 3. Let  \u03c6 1 ( \u00b7 ) be the feature map corresponding to  \u03ba 1 ( \u00b7 ,  \u00b7 ). Then by direct inspection we see that  \u03c6 ( \u00b7 ) =  \u03c6 1 ( f ( \u00b7 )) is the feature map corresponding to  \u03ba ( f ( \u00b7 ) , f ( \u00b7 )). Indeed, \u03c6 1 ( f ( x )) \u22a4 \u03c6 1 ( f ( x \u2032 )) =  \u03ba 1 ( f ( x ) , f ( x \u2032 ) =  \u03ba ( x ,  x \u2032 ) . 4. Clearly,  \u03c6 ( x ) =  f ( x ) will be the corresponding feature map. This problem caused lots of confusion and only few people got full points. Most people did not take the \u201deasy\u201d route outlined above but stated Mercer\u2019s condition. Recall that if we are given a  \u03ba ( \u00b7 ,  \u00b7 ) and a set of points  { x n } N n =1   then we can associate to this an  N  \u00d7  N  matrix  K  with entries  K i,j  =  \u03ba ( x i ,  x j ). Mercer\u2019s condition then requires that this matrix be symmetric and psd for any given set of points. Only few people stated what  K  was with respect to \u03ba . The symmetry was proven correctly by most but almost nobody gave a correct proof of the psd property. E.g., the product of two psd matrices is in general  not  psd. Adding to the confusion, some people \ufb01rst stated the correct representation as an inner product and  then  still tried to prove that Mercer\u2019s condition was ful\ufb01lled. Recall, Mercer\u2019s condition guarantees that  \u03ba  can be written as an inner product. But once you have explicitly provided an inner product representation there is no point in checking Mercer\u2019s condition. Other frequently made assertions: For point 4 many people stated that since the function f maps points from the domain to itself the kernel was \u201cstill\u201d valid. Indeed, this is what was asked to prove and the proof is simple. E.g., if you go the psd route you can observe that the matrix is simply now a matrix corresponding to di\ufb00erent choices of points and that the original matrix had to be psd for  any  choice of points. But simply stating that it was just a valid kernel did not get you any points. y y y y Page 25 / 29 3941009 \u2013 I Know All y y y y Page 26 / 29 3941009 \u2013 I Know All y y y y", "course": "ML"}, {"question": " Consider the  k -means algorithm.

However, explicit cycle breaking is required for full memory reclamation.\n Garbage collection has potentially lower performance overhead than reference counting and can\n reclaim cyclic data structures. It might also improve program performance by compacting data\n structures to fit the processor cache better. However, garbage collection usually introduces pauses\n in program execution to scan memory, which might be unsuitable for certain applications.\n 2\n Ownership and borrowing (as in Rust) tie object lifetimes to variable scopes. Like smart pointers\n in C++, they release an object when its encompassing variable goes out of scope. While owner-\n ship incurs a low cost, it might not meet all allocation and deallocation requirements, even with\n borrowing.

The inode bitmap is one block can track 32K objects\n since it is 4KB x 8 = 32Kbits.\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "Disks are not byte addressable, but rather consist of a large number of addressable sectors of 512 (or\n more) bytes with atomic read/write features. Consider a file system partition layout, where block\n size is 4KB and an inode size is 256 bytes, with 5 inode blocks, one bitmap block for both data and\n inodes and of course a superblock. Calculate the sector where inode 40 resides.\n", "answer": "Such calculations are actually used by device drivers to locate actual sectors, and then of course such\n information can be used for scheduling. In a standard layout, superblock is located in the beginning\n of the filesystem partition, and then bitmaps come. Afterwards, inodes are stored and finally the\n actual data portion starts. The following figure is taken from the book.\n As you can see, inodes start from 12KB assuming that file system partition offset is 0. Offset of 40th\n inode is 40 x 256 (size of inode) = 10240 bytes after the inode blocks are started. There are 12KB\n / 512B = 24 sectors until inodes start. And, 10240B / 512B = 20 sectors for the offset of inode 40.\n So the answer is the sector 24 + 20 = 44.\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "Give modification timeline of file system metadata and function calls to open file /foo/bar/os, read\n it and append 2 blocks to it.

Assume the superblock does not need to be modified.\n", "answer": "Please note that close() also be there but it does not require any access to the file system metadata.\n It only updates open files table.", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "What is the crash-consistency problem?\n", "answer": "We expect file systems to be persistent both in the perspective of the data storage and the metadata,\n even if confronted with system failure and/or power loss. Given that crashes (software bugs, hardware\n failure etc.) can occur at arbitrary points in time, to ensure the file system keeps the on-disk image in\n a reasonable state or to recover if it doesn\u2019t so defines the crash-consistency problem. It is basically\n keeping file system always in consistent state independent of possible failures. Since it happens due\n to updates it is also called the consistent-update problem.\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "What is FSCK? How does it work?\n", "answer": "fsck, file system checker, is a piece of software designed to resolve file system inconsistencies in\n UNIX-like systems. It runs before file system is mounted and made available; once it finishes, on-\n disk file system should be in a consistent state. How it works is described below. In a nutshell, it\n re-creates entire file system virtually in a tree-like structure from metadata and checks and resolves\n the inconsistencies along the way.\n Some of the things it does:\n 1. Checks if superblock in a reasonable state.\n If it is corrupted, use one of the backup copies\n version (if available)\n 2. Scans inodes, indirect blocks, double indirect blocks etc and virtually create file system tree. It\n uses such tree to produce the correct version of bitmap allocation (puts its trust to the inodes\n in this case).\n 3. Checks inodes state for file type, file size, link count etc. and corrects them if possible.\n If\n there exists a problem it marks inode as suspect and clears it later (of course by updating\n corresponding bitmap too).\n 4. Checks inode links and reference count. If an allocated inode is found but no directory refers\n to it then it is moved to lost+found directory.\n 5. Checks for duplicates and their state.\n 6. Checks for bad blocks by scanning all block pointers(!) for valid range, partition number etc.\n Removes bad block pointers.\n 7. Checks directories for \u201d.\u201d and \u201d..\u201d entries\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "What is the downside of FSCK?\n", "answer": "fsck requires intricate knowledge about file system. It is too slow and its performance goes even\n worse with RAID systems since it\u2019s not at all aware of them. Although it has fixing mechanisms\n for consistency, it is not infinitely clever: e.g. data corruptions are not fixable. (Deleting something\n without making sure of its usage is never a good idea.)\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "What is journaling?\n", "answer": "It is a proactive solution to the consistent-update problem aiming to keep the system always in\n a consistent and correct state. It also brings atomicity to the file system at the OS level since\n otherwise atomicity can only be achieved by the storage device. Journaling requires writing changes\n to the disk twice: first, any updates are written as a transaction/chain of transactions and second,\n actual updates are written to the correct places on the disk. Transactions are high level information\n describing which structure of the disk will be updated how. Transactions also include start and end\n blocks (with timestamps) that pave the way to atomicity.\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}, {"question": "How does journaling differ from FSCK?\n", "answer": "FSCK is a reactive approach which focuses on solving inconsistencies after they occur whereas\n journaling aims to prevent it. Also, FSCK does not guarantee correctness as opposed to journaling.\n FSCK does not introduce redundancy or any kind of data replication so cannot recover data losses\n unless data is already in the disk and referenced in inodes whereas journaling supports data recovery.\n", "course": "Introduction to operating systems"}]
