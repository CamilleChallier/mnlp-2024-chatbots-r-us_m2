The three blocks are made from the same material, as are two tables. As is typical, the coefficient of static friction between the blocks and the tables is greater than the coefficient of kinetic friction,  \u00b5 s  > \u00b5 k . 1. Imagine that, when the system is released from rest, you know block 3 accelerates downward with a constant magnitude  a , but only one of the other blocks moves. Which block does not move, and what is the magnitude and direction of the friction force holding it back? 2. Now consider the case where, after the blocks are released from rest, all three of them begin to move. Find the acceleration of all three blocks and the tension in the rope. 1 Applications of Newton\u2019s second law", "answer": "1. In this part, the vertical acceleration of block 3,  a 3 y  =  a , is a given quantity. Let  T  be the tension in the rope, which is constant throughout its length (as the rope is massless and the pulleys are massless and frictionless). The free body diagram on block 3 is shown below. Defining a coordinate system such that  \u02c6 y  points up (antiparallel to gravity), we find Newton\u2019s second law becomes 2 T  \u2212 m 3 g  =  \u2212 m 3 a (1) for block 3. We can solve this to find the tension T  =  1 2 m 3 ( g  \u2212 a ) . (2)  The problem tells us that the tension  T  exceeds the static friction force limit on one block, but not the other. To see which, we must calculate the static friction force, which requires us to know the normal forces. Thus, we draw the free body diagrams for both blocks (shown below), where  f 1  and  f 2 represent the friction force on each. We know that the friction force (whether it be static or kinetic) will point outwards as block 3 will tend to pull blocks 1 and 2 towards the pulleys. Since blocks 1 and 2 do not accelerate vertically, Newton\u2019s second law in the vertical direction gives N 1  \u2212 m 1 g  = 0 \u21d2 N 1  =  m 1 g (3) and N 2  \u2212 m 2 g  = 0 \u21d2 N 2  =  m 2 g (4) for blocks 1 and 2 respectively. Substituting this into the equation for the static friction force gives f 1  \u2264 \u00b5 s N 1  =  \u00b5 s m 1 g (5) and f 2  \u2264 \u00b5 s N 2  =  \u00b5 s m 2 g, (6) where we have used the same coefficient of static friction in both equations as the two blocks (and the tables they sit on) are made of the same material. From this we conclude that block 1 does  not  move and block 2  does  move because the maximum static friction force is higher on block 1 since  m 1  > m 2 . Since block 1 does not move, we can write the horizontal component of Newton\u2019s second law as T  \u2212 f 1  = 0 , (7) where we have defined  \u02c6 x  to point towards the right. Solving this equation for the friction force and substituting equation (2) gives the final answer \u2014 block 1 does not move and the friction force holding it back points horizontally to the left with magnitude f 1  =  1 2 m 3 ( g  \u2212 a ) . (8) Note we know that  g > a  as block 3 would only accelerate at  g  if it were in free fall. Any upwards force (such as that from the rope) would only serve to slow its downwards acceleration. 2. Now consider the case where, after being released from rest, all three blocks begin to move. We are trying to solve for the accelerations  a 1 x ,  a 2 x , and  a 3 y  as well as the tension  T  in the rope. Thus, to solve for these 4 unknowns we need four equations. The free body diagrams for all three blocks remain the same (shown above), though all the friction forces are kinetic friction as every block is now moving. For all objects, we will choose to use a single coordinate system with  \u02c6 y  pointing upward and  \u02c6 x  pointing to the right, though other choices are possible. Given this coordinate system, Newton\u2019s second law for block 1 is T  \u2212 f 1  =  m 1 a 1 x (9) in the horizontal direction, while it is N 1  \u2212 m 1 g  = 0 (10)  in the vertical direction (since there is no vertical acceleration). Therefore, as in part 1, we find N 1  =  m 1 g, (11) so the  kinetic  friction force is f 1  =  \u00b5 k N 1  =  \u00b5 k m 1 g. (12) Substituting this into equation (9) gives T  \u2212 \u00b5 k m 1 g  =  m 1 a 1 x . (13) Next, we consider block 2. Given its free body diagram (shown above), Newton\u2019s second law is f 2  \u2212 T  =  m 2 a 2 x (14) in the horizontal direction, while it is N 2  \u2212 m 2 g  = 0 (15) in the vertical direction (since there is no vertical acceleration). Therefore, as in part 1, we find N 2  =  m 2 g, (16) so the  kinetic  friction force is f 2  =  \u00b5 k N 2  =  \u00b5 k m 2 g. (17) Substituting this into equation (14) gives \u00b5 k m 2 g  \u2212 T  =  m 2 a 2 x . (18) Lastly, we turn to block 3. Given its free body diagram (shown above), Newton\u2019s second law is 2 T  \u2212 m 3 g  =  m 3 a 3 y (19) in the vertical direction and  0 = 0  in the horizontal direction. We can collect the equations for the three blocks (equations (13), (18), and (19)): T  \u2212 \u00b5 k m 1 g  =  m 1 a 1 x (20) \u00b5 k m 2 g  \u2212 T  =  m 2 a 2 x (21) 2 T  \u2212 m 3 g  =  m 3 a 3 y . (22) g x 1 x 2 m 2 m 1 m 3 y 3 y x s 3 s 2 s 1  However, we are still missing one equation (given that we have four unknowns and only three equations). This is the constraint condition. More specifically, studying the geometry of the system (see the figure above), we see that the motion of the three blocks is related by a geometrical constraint: because the rope is inextensible (i.e. does not stretch), its length  L  is constant. However, quantifying its length is complicated given that the blocks move. There are many different approaches to do this, which will give the same answer. We choose to define a single coordinate system for all three blocks and place its origin equidistant between the center of the two fixed pulleys (as shown above). Then we quantify some missing fixed distances (e.g. the radii of the pulleys  R ), which, as we will see, won\u2019t end up mattering as they don\u2019t change as the blocks move. Finally, we can add up all the sections of rope to express the total length of the rope as L  = ( \u2212 x 1 + s 1 )+   \u03c0 2   R +( \u2212 y 3 + s 3 )+ \u03c0R +( \u2212 y 3 + s 3 )+  \u03c0 2   R +( x 2 \u2212 s 2 ) =  \u2212 x 1 + x 2 \u2212 2 y 3 + s 1 \u2212 s 2 +2 s 3 +2 \u03c0R. (23) Note that we have accounted for the fact that some of the positions (e.g.  x 1  and  y 3 ) will be negative, given our definitions of  \u02c6 x  and  \u02c6 y . If we differentiate equation (23) twice with respect to time, we find 0 =  \u2212 a 1 x  +  a 2 x  \u2212 2 a 3 y . (24) Note that all of the unknown distances, like  R  and  s 1 , have disappeared as they don\u2019t change with time. Equation (24) is the equation that we were missing. We now have four equations (i.e. (20), (21), (22), and (24)) with which we can solve for the four unknowns ( a 1 x , a 2 x ,  a 3 y , and the tension  T ). We solve equation (20) to find a 1 x  =   T m 1 \u2212 \u00b5 k g, (25) equation (21) to find a 2 x  =  \u00b5 k g  \u2212 T m 2 , (26) and equation (22) to find a 3 y  =  2 T m 3 \u2212 g. (27) Substituting these three results into equation (24) gives 0 =  \u2212 \u0012  T m 1 \u2212 \u00b5 k g \u0013 + \u0012 \u00b5 k g  \u2212 T m 2 \u0013 \u2212 2 \u0012  2 T m 3 \u2212 g \u0013 . (28) We rearrange this equation to find that the tension is T  = 2 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 1 m 1   + 1 m 2   + 4 m 3 \u0011 . (29) We can now substitute our solution for the tension to find the accelerations. Equation (25) becomes a 1 x  = 2 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 1 +   m 1 m 2   +  4 m 1 m 3 \u0011  \u2212 \u00b5 k g, (30) equation (26) becomes a 2 x  =  \u00b5 k g  \u2212 2 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 m 2 m 1   + 1 + 4  m 2 m 3 \u0011 , (31)  and equation (27) becomes a 3 y  = 4 g ( \u00b5 k  + 1) \u0010 m 3 m 1   +  m 3 m 2   + 4 \u0011  \u2212 g. (32) Note that the signs of these accelerations depend on the coordinate system used and so may be different in your solution. However, the tension given by equation (29) is a physical force and is independent of the choice of coordinates.

There is no friction between the ladder and the wall. What is the maximum possible angle  \u03b1 m  before the foot of the ladder begins to slip and the ladder falls down? How does it depend on  m ?

These are shown in the figure below, where we have define a Cartesian coordinate system with its origin at the center of mass of the ladder. x y N 1 N 2 z F f F g r N 1  =  r f \u03b1 r N 2 We know that when  \u03b1 < \u03b1 m , the ladder is in equilibrium.

Equations (2) and (3) represent a system of two equations, but we have three unknowns:  N 1 ,  N 2 , and  F f (we know the maximum value of the friction force is  F   max f =  \u00b5N 1 , but we don\u2019t know how  F f  depends on \u03b1 ). To solve the problem, we must consider the torque on the ladder  \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u20d7 r  \u00d7   \u20d7 F . In equilibrium, the ladder does not turn, so the net torque must be zero. We choose the center of mass of the ladder (i.e. the origin in the above diagram) to be the pivot point. Then, we write down the net torque about this point from all the forces in the problem \u20d7 \u03c4 net  = X \u20d7 \u03c4  =  \u20d7 r g  \u00d7   \u20d7 F g  +  \u20d7 r N 1  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 1  +  \u20d7 r N 2  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 2  +  \u20d7 r f  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  = 0 , (4) where the position vectors go  from  the pivot point  to  the point of application of the force (as shown in the above diagram). Given that the position vector for the gravitational force is  \u20d7 r g  = 0 , we find \u20d7 r N 1  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 1  +  \u20d7 r N 2  \u00d7   \u20d7 N 2  +  \u20d7 r f  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  = 0 . (5) The magnitude of all the other position vectors is  | \u20d7 r N 1 |  =  | \u20d7 r N 2 |  =  | \u20d7 r f |  =  L/ 2 . Using the right-hand rule for the cross product, we can determine the direction of each term in equation (5). Each one is in the  \u02c6 z direction, however the sign is positive for   \u20d7 N 1  and negative for   \u20d7 F f  and   \u20d7 N 2 . Next, we can use the cross product definition that   \u20d7 A  \u00d7   \u20d7 B  =  |   \u20d7 A ||   \u20d7 B |  sin  \u03b8  =  AB  sin  \u03b8  (where  \u03b8  is the angle between   \u20d7 A  and   \u20d7 B ). This gives L 2   N 1  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 L 2   N 2  sin \u0010 \u03c0 2   \u2212 \u03b1 \u0011 \u2212 L 2   F f  sin \u0010 \u03c0 2   \u2212 \u03b1 \u0011 = 0 . (6) Using the trigonometric identity that  sin ( \u03c0/ 2  \u2212 \u03b1 ) = cos  \u03b1  gives N 1  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 N 2  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F f  cos  \u03b1  = 0 . (7) This is the third equation that we need to solve our system of equations. Thus, we substitute equations (2) and (3) to obtain mg  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 F f  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F f  cos  \u03b1  = 0 \u21d2 F f  =   mg 2  tan  \u03b1. (8) The static friction will be able to restrain the ladder as long as F F r  < F   max F r =  \u00b5N 1  =  \u00b5mg, (9) where we have used equation (3). Substituting equation (8) into equation (9) allows us to determine the maximum angle for which the ladder does not fall down to be tan  \u03b1 m  = 2 \u00b5 \u21d2 \u03b1 m  = arctan(2 \u00b5 ) .

Choosing to use a spherical coordinate system, the change in the potential energy due to the force   \u20d7 F is \u2206 U  =  U ( R )  \u2212 U ( \u221e ) =  \u2212 Z C \u20d7 F  \u00b7  d \u20d7 l  =  \u2212 Z C \u0012 \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 r 2 +   C r 3 \u0013 \u02c6 r  \u00b7 \u0010 dr \u02c6 r  +  rd\u03b8 \u02c6 \u03b8  +  r  sin  \u03b8d\u03d5 \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 = Z C \u0012 Gm 1 m 2 r 2 \u2212 C r 3 \u0013 dr, (1) where the integration path  C  is along the trajectory from  r  =  \u221e to  r  =  R . However, we see that, since the force is purely radial, only the change in the radial position matters. Thus, we can write \u2206 U  =  U ( R )  \u2212 U ( \u221e ) = Z  R \u221e Gm 1 m 2 r 2 \u2212 C r 3  dr. (2) Taking the integral gives a potential energy difference of \u2206 U  =  U ( R )  \u2212 U ( \u221e ) = \u0012 \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 r +   C 2 r 2 \f \f \f \f R \u221e =  \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 R + C 2 R 2  . (3) Since the reference point for the potential energy is at  r  =  \u221e (i.e. we define the potential energy such that  U ( \u221e ) = 0 ), equation (3) implies that U ( R ) =  \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 R + C 2 R 2  , (4) which will be useful in the next part of the problem. 2. Equilibrium occurs when the force on a particle is zero. Thus, we can find the locations  R  =  R 0  that satisfy this by enforcing \u20d7 F ( R 0 ) = 0 \u21d2 \u0012 \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 R 2 0 +   C R 3 0 \u0013 \u02c6 r  = 0 \u21d2 Gm 1 m 2 R 2 0 =   C R 3 0 . (5) Solving for  R 0  shows that there is just one equilibrium point at R 0  = C Gm 1 m 2 . (6) Using this result and equation (4), we find that the value of the potential energy at  R  =  R 0  is U ( R 0 ) =  \u2212 Gm 1 m 2 R 0 + C 2 R 2 0 =  \u2212 ( Gm 1 m 2 ) 2 C +  ( Gm 1 m 2 ) 2 2 C =  \u2212 ( Gm 1 m 2 ) 2 2 C . (7) To see if this equilibrium point is stable or not, we can calculate the second derivative of the potential energy and see if it is positive or negative. Using equation (4) to do so gives dU dR   =  Gm 1 m 2 R 2 \u2212 C R 3 \u21d2 d 2 U dR 2  =  \u2212 2 Gm 1 m 2 R 3 + 3   C R 4  . (8) Evaluating this at  R  =  R 0  using equation (6) and simplifying produces d 2 U dR 2 \f \f \f \f R = R 0 =  \u2212 2 Gm 1 m 2 R 3 0 + 3   C R 4 0 =  \u2212 2 ( Gm 1 m 2 ) 4 C 3 + 3 ( Gm 1 m 2 ) 4 C 3 =  ( Gm 1 m 2 ) 4 C 3 . (9) Given that  C  must be positive for the repulsive portion of the force in the problem statement to be repulsive, we see that  d 2 U/dR 2 | R = R 0  >  0 , so the equilibrium point is stable. 2 Potential energy, conservation of energy - 9 ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "Sally swings a ball of mass  m  in a circle of radius  R  in an upright vertical plane by means of a massless string. The speed of the ball is constant and it makes one revolution every  t 0  seconds. g \u03b8 1.

Note that while the ball moves in a circle, Sally\u2019s hand cannot remain at the center of the circle, if a constant speed is to be maintained. Express your answer in terms of some combination of the parameters  m ,  R ,  t 0 , and the gravitational constant  g . 2. Is there a range of values of  t 0  for which this type of circular motion can  not  be maintained? If so, what is that range? ", "answer": "1. The free body diagram for the ball is shown below. Note the   \u02c6 \u03d5  component of the tension arises because Sally\u2019s hand does not stay in the center of the circle, so the string does not pull precisely in the radial direction. From the free body diagram, we see that Newton\u2019s second law   P  \u20d7 F  =  m\u20d7 a  in the radial g mg T \u03c1 T \u03d5 \u03b8 direction is \u2212 T \u03c1  \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8  =  \u2212 mR\u03c9 2 , where we have used the fact that the centripetal acceleration needed for circular motion is  \u20d7 a  =  \u2212 R\u03c9 2 \u02c6 \u03c1 . Rearranging, we find the tension to be T \u03c1  =  mR\u03c9 2   \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8. Because the angular frequency is related to the period through  \u03c9  = 2 \u03c0/t 0 , the magnitude of the radial component of the tension in the string is T \u03c1 ( \u03b8 ) =  4 \u03c0 2 mR t 2 0 \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8. 2. A string cannot push. Thus, the magnitude of the radial component of the tension in the string  T \u03c1 must be greater than zero at all points in the circular motion. If  T \u03c1  <  0  the ball will move inwards and the path will no longer be circular. This means that, using the final result from part 1, circular motion will not be maintained if T \u03c1 ( \u03b8 ) =  4 \u03c0 2 mR t 2 0 \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8 <  0 4  at any point along the trajectory. From this equation we see that  \u03b8  = 0  (i.e. the top of the circle) is the most prone location to breakdown. This is because the gravitational term  \u2212 mg  cos  \u03b8  makes its largest negative contribution to the required radial force  T \u03c1  (since  cos(0) = 1  is the maximum value of cos  \u03b8 ). Thus, taking  \u03b8  = 0  and solving the above equation for the period  t 0  gives the condition for the breakdown of circular motion.

The tortoise and hare start with constant velocities,  v t  and  v h  respectively. The hare is not taking this race seriously, so its velocity is less than the tortoise\u2019s. Once the tortoise arrives at a bridge a distance  L \u2032   < L  from the start, the hare realizes it could lose and accelerates with a constant acceleration  a . Express this problem mathematically. Find the condition on  a  that will allow the hare to win the race. Check your result in terms of units. Brainstorm limiting cases for which you have clear intuition about the solution. In these limiting cases, does your expression for  a  make sense? ", "answer": "In this problem we take as given the length of the race  L , the distance to the bridge  L \u2032 , the velocity of the tortoise  v t , and the initial velocity of the hare  v h . We must calculate the accelerate  a  needed for the hare to win the race. As in problem 3 of problem set 1, we will define  t 0  = 0  as the time the race starts,  t 1  as the time at which the tortoise reaches the bridge (which is when the hare starts to accelerate), and  t 2  as the arrival time of the tortoise. Additionally, can also define the time durations  \u2206 t  =  t 1  \u2212 t 0  and  \u2206 t \u2032   =  t 2  \u2212 t 1  of the first and second phases of the race respectively. We draw a schematic of the race in the figure below, where  x t  is the position of the tortoise and  x h  is the position of the hare. h During both phases of the race, the tortoise travels at the same constant speed  v t . Given that we have defined the origin to be its initial position, the tortoise\u2019s equation of motion is x t ( t ) =  v t t. Thus, it reaches the bridge when x t ( t 1 ) =  L \u2032   =  v t t 1 , so t 1  =   L \u2032 v t . (28) Similarly, the tortoise reaches the finish line when x t ( t 2 ) =  L  =  v t t 2 , so t 2  =   L v t . (29) During the first phase of the race (from  t 0  to  t 1 ), the hare maintains a constant speed  v h . Thus, its equation of motion is x h ( t ) =  v h t. However, when the  tortoise  reaches the bridge at time  t 1 , the  hare\u2019s  motion changes to constant acceleration a . At  t 1 , the hare\u2019s velocity is still  v h  and we can calculate its position to be x h ( t 1 ) =  v h t 1 . By substituting equation (28), we find x h ( t 1 ) =  L \u2032  v h v t . 10  The general equation of motion for constant acceleration can be found by integration (as we have done for the vertical direction of projectile motion) to be x h ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v h 0 t  +  x h 0 . From our analysis of the first phase, we know the initial position of the second phase is  x h 0  =  L \u2032 v h /v t , while the initial velocity of the second phase is  v h 0  =  v h . Therefore, the equation of motion becomes x h ( t ) =   a 2 t 2  +  v h t  +  L \u2032  v h v t . Note that in this equation we have adopted a new time coordinate system, defined such that the time  t  = 0 corresponds to the start of the second phase of the race. Given this, we know that the hare must arrive at the finish line  x  =  L  at a time  t  =  t 2  \u2212 t 1  after the start of the second phase in order to tie the tortoise. This corresponds to the condition x h ( t 2  \u2212 t 1 ) =   a 2 ( t 2  \u2212 t 1 ) 2  +  v h ( t 2  \u2212 t 1 ) +  L \u2032  v h v t =  L. Using equations (28) and (29) to replace  t 1  and  t 2 , we find a 2 \u0012  L v t \u2212 L \u2032 v t \u0013 2 +  v h \u0012  L v t \u2212 L \u2032 v t \u0013 +  L \u2032  v h v t =  L. This equation contains only  a  and known quantities. To produce the simplest expression, we will first multiply the entire equation by  2 v 2 t   to find a  ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2   + 2 v t v h  ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) + 2 v t L \u2032 v h  = 2 v 2 t   L. Rearranging produces a  ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2   = 2 v 2 t   L  \u2212 2 v t v h L. Finally, simplifying further yields the solution of a  =  2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 . Therefore, in order for the hare to win the race, it must accelerate faster than this, producing the condition that a >   2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 . To verify our result, we can check the units h m s 2 i = \u0002  m s \u0003 [ m ] \u0002  m s \u0003 [ m ] 2 . We can also check the following limiting cases. Limiting case 1 : The tortoise has an initial velocity that is much greater than that of the hare. For this, we expect that the acceleration of the hare must be very large in order to beat the tortoise. Mathematically, we write this as  v t  \u2192\u221e . In this case the acceleration becomes lim v t \u2192\u221e a  = lim v t \u2192\u221e 2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 =  \u221e 11  Limiting case 2 : The tortoise and the hare have an equal velocity before the bridge. For this we expect that the hare does not need to accelerate at all in order to tie the race. Mathematically, we write this as v t  =  v h . We see that a  =  2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 = 0 . Limiting case 3 : The bridge is situated close to the finish line, making the second phase of the race very short. For this we expect that the hare\u2019s acceleration will need to be very large in order to win the race. Mathematically, we write this as  L \u2032   \u2192 L . We see that lim L \u2032 \u2192 L   a  = lim L \u2032 \u2192 L 2 v t L  ( v t  \u2212 v h ) ( L  \u2212 L \u2032 ) 2 =  \u221e . 12  ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": " For the question, mark the box (without erasing) TRUE if the statement is  always true  and the box FALSE if it is  not always true  (i.e., it is sometimes false).

Since the wheel does not slip, what can we say about the value of the static friction coefficient  \u00b5 s between the wheel and the table? m m R 1 Rotation, translation, and rolling", "answer": "y b x w T T mg mg F f N x y z 1. Consider the system composed of the wheel and the block (i.e. the two objects in the problem that move and have mass). Since we are asked about the state of the system at a particular  position  (i.e. after the center of the wheel has traveled a distance  d ), it is best to use conservation of energy. If we were asked about the system after a given amount of time  t , it would be easiest to use Newton\u2019s laws. The forces on the wheel are gravity   \u20d7 F gw  =  mg \u02c6 y , the normal force from the table   \u20d7 N  =  \u2212 N  \u02c6 y , and the tension from the wire   \u20d7 T  =  T  \u02c6 x . Additionally, we can infer that there must be a static friction force F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s N  in the  \u2212 \u02c6 x  direction, in order for the wheel to roll without slipping. The forces on the block are gravity   \u20d7 F gb  =  mg \u02c6 y  and the tension force from the wire   \u20d7 T  =  \u2212 T  \u02c6 y . The tension in the wire at the block must be equal in magnitude to the tension at the wheel as both the rope and pulley are massless. Since tension is an internal force that does not dissipate any energy, the only nonconservative forces that could be doing work on the system are the normal force   \u20d7 N  and the friction force   \u20d7 F f . However, since the wheel is rolling without slipping, both forces are not being applied over a distance, just at a changing but always stationary point. This is analogous to a box sitting on a table. You can push the box slightly and static friction will keep it at rest by opposing the applied force. In this case, friction does no work as the box is stationary the entire time, so the force is applied over zero distance. Another way to see this is by considering the power  P  =   \u20d7 F  \u00b7  \u20d7 v . Since the velocity of the point of the wheel in contact with the ground is  \u20d7 v  = 0 , the power is clearly  P  = 0 . Since the power  P  =  dW/dt is also the time derivative of the work  W , the work must be a constant value throughout the motion of the block. Since the amount of work done by the friction and normal forces on the wheel is zero initially (as the system has yet to start to move), this means they never do any work. Thus mechanical energy is conserved throughout the motion of the system. 1 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 The total mechanical energy of the system is given by E m  =  K rot w +  K trans w +  K trans b +  U gb \u21d2 E m  =   I w 2   \u03c9 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b (1) \u21d2 E m  =   m 4   R 2 \u03c9 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b , (2) where  K rot w is the rotational kinetic energy of the wheel,  K trans w is the translational kinetic energy of the wheel,  K trans b is the translational kinetic energy of the falling block,  U gb  is the gravitational potential energy of the block, I w  =   m 2   R 2 (3) is the moment of inertia of the uniform solid wheel rotating about its center,  \u03c9 w  is the angular speed of the wheel,  v w  is the speed of the center of mass of the wheel,  v b  is the speed of the block, and we have defined a Cartesian coordinate system as shown in the figure above. Using the no-slip condition, we know that the speed of the center of the wheel is v w  =  R\u03c9 w \u21d2 \u03c9 w  =   v w R  . (4) Substituting this into equation (2) gives E m  =   m 4   R 2  \u0010 v w R \u0011 2 +   m 2   v 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b \u21d2 E m  =  3 4 mv 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 b   \u2212 mgy b . (5) Since the wire is inextensible and we have carefully defined our coordinate system such that  x w  = 0 and  y b  = 0  initially, we can see the constraint condition is  y b  =  x w . Taking a derivative in time gives v b  =  v w . (6) Substituting these two relations into equation (5) gives E m  =  3 4 mv 2 w   +  m 2   v 2 w   \u2212 mgx w   = 5 4 mv 2 w   \u2212 mgx w . (7) Now we can apply conservation of mechanical energy between the initial state (when everything is at rest) and the final state (when the center of the wheel has moved by a distance  x w  =  d ) to find 0  \u2212 0 =  5 4 mv 2 w   \u2212 mgd, (8) where we have take the reference point for the gravitational potential energy of each object to be their initial location. Solving for the final velocity of the center of the wheel gives v w  = r 4 5 gd. (9) 2. For the wheel not to slip, the static friction force must not exceed its maximum magnitude of F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s N. (10) Drawing a free body diagram for the wheel and looking at Newton\u2019s second law in the vertical direction shows that the normal force has a magnitude of  N  =  mg . Thus, we find F f  \u2264 \u00b5 s mg. (11) 2 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 By rearranging we find that the coefficient of static friction must be sufficiently high to satisfy \u00b5 s  \u2265 F f mg  , (12) otherwise the wheel will slip. In order to determine  F f , we must analyze the entire system. We can apply Newton\u2019s second law to the wheel to get the equation X F wx  =  ma w \u21d2 T  \u2212 F f  =  m dv w dt \u21d2 T  =  F f  +  m dv w dt (13) in the horizontal direction, where  a w  is the acceleration of the center of the wheel. Applying Newton\u2019s second law to the falling block and substituting equation (13) gives X F by  =  ma b \u21d2 mg  \u2212 T  =  m dv b dt \u21d2 mg  \u2212 F f  \u2212 m dv w dt   =  mdv b dt  . (14) From the constraint condition of equation (6), we find mg  \u2212 F f  \u2212 m dv w dt   =  mdv w dt \u21d2 mg  \u2212 F f  = 2 m dv w dt \u21d2 dv w dt   =  g 2   \u2212 F f 2 m . (15) Lastly, applying Newton\u2019s second law for the rotational motion of the wheel about its center gives X \u20d7 \u03c4 w  =  I w \u20d7 \u03b1 w \u21d2 R \u02c6 y  \u00d7   \u20d7 F f  =  I w d\u03c9 w dt   \u02c6 z \u21d2 R \u02c6 y  \u00d7  ( \u2212 F f  \u02c6 x ) =  I w d\u03c9 w dt \u21d2 F f  =   I w R d\u03c9 w dt (16) in the  \u02c6 z  direction, where  \u20d7 \u03b1 w  is the angular acceleration of the wheel (which is the derivative of the angular velocity  \u20d7 \u03c9 w ). There are no other torques on the wheel because tension and gravity act at the pivot point and the normal force is anti-parallel to the position vector to its point of application (i.e. the cross product in the torque evaluates to zero). Substituting equations (3), (4), and (15) into equation (16) gives F f  =  1 R \u0010 m 2   R 2 \u0011 \u0012  1 R dv w dt \u0013 =   m 2 \u0012 g 2   \u2212 F f 2 m \u0013 =  1 4 mg  \u2212 1 4 F f , (17) which can be rearranged to show F f  =  1 5 mg. (18) Substituting this into equation (12) reveals the condition on the static coefficient of friction to be \u00b5 s  \u2265 1 5  = 0 . 2 . (19) This is quite a fundamental solution as we see that it is independent of the mass  m  and radius  R . The main requirement for it to be applicable is that the wheel and block must have the same mass. 3 Rotation, translation, and rolling - 14 ", "course": "Physique meca"}, {"question": "An anti-malware tool adds up the sizes of all files on a disk, adds the size of the empty space and\n compares it to the total disk size.\n What type of malware is this software trying to detect?

If the mass is just barely able to complete the loop without ever losing contact with the track, what height  h  did the object start at? Assume that the track is frictionless and neglect air resistance. ", "answer": "This problem is similar to problem 1. As the block is initially at rest  v 0  = 0 , the initial kinetic energy is K 0  =  mv 2 0 / 2 = 0 . The initial potential energy is due to gravity. We will define the reference point to be at the height of the table, so the initial height of the object is  y 0  =  h  and the initial gravitational potential energy is  U g 0  =  mgh . Therefore, the total initial energy is E 0  =  K 0  +  U g 0  = 0 +  mgh  =  mgh. (1) At the top of the loop  y t  = 2 R , the kinetic energy is  K t  =  mv 2 t   / 2  and the gravitational potential energy is U gt  =  mgy t  = 2 mgR . Thus, the total energy at the top of the loop is given by E t  =  K t  +  U gt  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (2) Since the track is frictionless and there is no air drag, there is no non-conservative force and mechanical energy is conserved. We can use equations (1) and (2) to write E 0  =  E t \u21d2 mgh  =   m 2   v 2 t   + 2 mgR. (3) y From the properties of circular motion, we know that the acceleration in the radial direction is equal to the centripetal acceleration  a cent  =  \u2212 v 2 t   /R . Thus, at the top of the loop (shown in figure above) Newton\u2019s second law in the  \u02c6 y  direction is \u2212 mg  \u2212 N  =  \u2212 mv 2 t R  . (4) From the information given in the problem statement, we know that the mass just barely doesn\u2019t lose contact with the track.

In this part, the static friction can be considered to be  F s  \u2248 0  because the coefficient of static friction is so small. As we are analyzing circular motion, we choose a cylindrical coordinate system as shown in the figure below, where the unit vector  \u02c6 \u03c1  points in the outward radial direction,   \u02c6 \u03d5  points into the page around the curve, and  \u02c6 z  points upwards. The free body diagram on the car is also shown. \u03b1 R v N mg z \u03c1 \u03d5 Given the free body diagram and the form of the centripetal acceleration  \u20d7 a  =  \u2212 ( v 2 0 /R )\u02c6 \u03c1  for circular motion, Newton\u2019s second law   P  \u20d7 F  =  m\u20d7 a  in the  \u02c6 \u03c1  direction is \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 0 R  . We can tell that the trigonometric function in this equation is sine rather than cosine by imagining the case that  \u03b1  = 0 . If  \u03b1  = 0 , the  \u02c6 \u03c1  component of   \u20d7 N  would be 0. Since  sin(0) = 0  and  cos(0) = 1 , the  \u02c6 \u03c1 component of   \u20d7 N  should contain  sin( \u03b1 ) . In the  \u02c6 z  direction Newton\u2019s second law is N  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 mg  =  ma z . Because the car is traveling in a circle and does not slide up or down, the acceleration in the  \u02c6 z  direction is zero  a z  = 0 . Thus, the components of Newton\u2019s second law become N  sin  \u03b1  =   mv 2 0 R and N  cos  \u03b1  =  mg. Dividing these equations to eliminate  N  yields tan  \u03b1  =   v 2 0 Rg  , which we can solve for the speed  v 0  that is necessary to maintain circular motion. We find v 0  = p Rg  tan  \u03b1. We now reconsider the problem with a non-zero coefficient of static friction  \u00b5 s . In this part, the speed of the car  v  =  v min  is so slow that it just barely doesn\u2019t slip down the bank. The static friction force must point up the incline as we know that it is preventing the car from slipping down. The free body diagram on the car is shown in the figure below, from which we see that Newton\u2019s second law is \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  +  F s  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R in the  \u02c6 \u03c1  direction and N  cos  \u03b1  +  F s  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 mg  =  ma z in the  \u02c6 z  direction. \u03b1 R v N mg F s z \u03d5 \u03c1 When  v  =  v min , the car still isn\u2019t slipping so the acceleration in the  \u02c6 z  direction  a z  = 0  is still zero, but the static friction has its maximum magnitude of  F s  =  \u00b5 s N . Thus, Newton\u2019s second law becomes \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s N  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 min R and N  cos  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s N  sin  \u03b1  =  mg. Dividing these equations to eliminate  N  yields \u2212 sin  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1 =  \u2212 v 2 min Rg  , which can then be solved for the minimum speed necessary to avoid sliding down the embanked turn v min  = s Rg   sin  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1   = r Rg   tan  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s 1 +  \u00b5 s  tan  \u03b1 . The limiting cases of this result can be checked. In the limit  \u00b5 s  \u2192 0 ,  v min  \u2192 \u221a Rg  tan  \u03b1 , which is consistent with the result for part 1. In the limit  \u00b5 s  \u2192 tan  \u03b1 ,  v min  \u2192 0 , which is the solution for the static case of a block sitting on an incline. 3. We now consider the case where the car is at the maximum speed  v  =  v max  such that it is almost slipping up the inclined plane. For this case, the direction of static friction now points down the incline plane and the free body diagram is shown below. The analysis is identical to the previous case, except the static friction force changes sign. Thus Newton\u2019s second law become \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R (1) in the  \u02c6 \u03c1  direction and N  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 mg  = 0 (2) 2  \u03b1 R v N mg F s z \u03d5 \u03c1 in the  \u02c6 z  direction. When  v  =  v max , the static friction has its maximum value of  F s  =  \u00b5 s N , so Newton\u2019s second law becomes \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s N  cos  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 max R and N  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s N  sin  \u03b1  =  mg. Dividing these two equations to eliminate  N  yields \u2212 sin  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1 =  \u2212 v 2 max Rg  , which can then be solved for the maximum speed  v max  to avoid sliding up the embanked turn v max  = s Rg   sin  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s  cos  \u03b1 cos  \u03b1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  sin  \u03b1   = r Rg   tan  \u03b1  +  \u00b5 s 1  \u2212 \u00b5 s  tan  \u03b1 . This solution is identical to that of part 2, except the sign in front of  \u00b5 s  is opposite. The figure below shows a plot of  v 2 / ( Rg )  versus  \u00b5 s  when  \u03b1  = 45 \u25e6 . The shaded area represents the set of  ( \u00b5 s , v 2 / ( Rg ))  points where the car remains in a circular path. Above the shaded region the car will slid up and out, while below the shaded region the car will slide down and in. \u03bc 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 v 2 /( Rg ) Skid outwards Follow circular path Skid inwards 4. The analysis is the same as in part 3, but the magnitude of the static friction is less than its maximum value. However, now the problem statement gives us the velocity  v  as a known quantity. Hence, we can combine equations (1) and (2) to eliminate  N  and solve for  F s . To do so, we multiply (1) by  cos  \u03b1 and (2) by  sin  \u03b1  to find \u2212 N  sin  \u03b1  cos  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  cos 2   \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R cos  \u03b1 3  and N  cos  \u03b1  sin  \u03b1  \u2212 F s  sin 2   \u03b1  \u2212 mg  sin  \u03b1  = 0 . Adding these two equations yields \u2212 F s \u0000 cos 2   \u03b1  + sin 2   \u03b1 \u0001 \u2212 mg  sin  \u03b1  =  \u2212 mv 2 R cos  \u03b1. Using the identity  cos 2   \u03b1  + sin 2   \u03b1  = 1  gives F s  =  m \u0012 v 2 R   cos  \u03b1  \u2212 g  sin  \u03b1 \u0013 for the magnitude of the static friction force.

The opposite end of the rope is pulled horizontally with a force   \u20d7 F a . The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and table is  \u00b5 k , while friction between the rope and table can be neglected. Find the tension in the rope as a function of the distance from the block. L M F a x y m b 2 ", "answer": "There are several methods to solve this problem. Below we show two of them. 1. In method 1, we will use differential elements. To calculate the tension, we start by considering a small piece of rope with length  \u2206 x  and its left end located at an arbitrary position  x  along the rope. Here we define a coordinate system where  x  = 0  is the location at which the rope connects to the block and \u02c6 x  points to the right. Since the rope has a uniform linear mass density  \u03bb , we can calculate the mass of the differential element  \u2206 m  to be \u03bb  =   M L   = \u2206 m \u2206 x \u21d2 \u2206 m  =   M L   \u2206 x. (1) Drawing a free body diagram for the piece of rope, we see that Newton\u2019s second law in the  \u02c6 x  direction is given by T ( x  + \u2206 x )  \u2212 T ( x ) = \u2206 ma r , (2) where  a r  is the acceleration of the piece of rope. Substituting equation (1) and rearranging gives T ( x  + \u2206 x )  \u2212 T ( x ) = \u0012 M L   \u2206 x \u0013 a r \u21d2 T ( x  + \u2206 x )  \u2212 T ( x ) \u2206 x =   M L  a r . (3) Taking the limit that the differential element is infinitesimally small  \u2206 x  \u2192 0  produces the differential equation dT dx   =  M L  a r . (4) Importantly, since the rope does not stretch, we know that the entire rope must move together. This implies that all the different pieces of the rope accelerate together. In other words,  a r  =  a  does not vary with  x  location. This can be seen as a constraint condition. Thus, we can directly integrate equation (4) to find T ( x ) =   M L  ax  +  C, (5) where  C  is an integration constant. To find the value of  C  we must apply a boundary condition. We can  either  use  T ( L ) =  F a  or find a condition on  T (0)  by analyzing the block. The first is quicker and allows us to directly calculate T ( L ) =  F a  =   M L  aL  +  C \u21d2 C  =  F a  \u2212 Ma (6) from equation (5). The second is more work. We draw a free body diagram for the block and see that Newton\u2019s second law in the  \u02c6 x  direction is F rb  \u2212 F f  =  m b a, (7) where  F rb  is the force of the rope on the block and we know that the block must have the same acceleration  a  as the rope. To calculate the kinetic friction force  F f  =  \u00b5 k N , we must know the normal force  N . This can be found from the  \u02c6 y  component of Newton\u2019s second law for the block to be N  \u2212 m b g  = 0 \u21d2 N  =  m b g (8) since the block has no acceleration in the vertical direction. Thus, the kinetic friction force is given by F f  =  \u00b5 k m b g.

After losing contact with the spring at  x  = 0  (which is the equilibrium position of the spring), the object travels a distance  d  along a horizontal track with a coefficient of friction that varies with position according to  \u00b5 ( x ) =  \u00b5 0  +  \u00b5 1 ( x/d ) . Following the horizontal track, the object enters a quarter turn of a frictionless loop with radius  R . Finally, after exiting the quarter turn of the loop, the object travels vertically upwards to a maximum height  h  (as measured from the horizontal surface). Find the maximum height  h  that the object attains in terms of the constants:  m ,  k ,  x 0 ,  \u00b5 0 ,  \u00b5 1 ,  d ,  R , and the acceleration due to gravity  g  (not all may be needed). ", "answer": "This problem may seem complicated at first (all those parameters!), but the work-kinetic energy theorem makes it tractable, even simple. The work-kinetic energy theorem tells us that the work done by the net force on the object is equal to the change in its kinetic energy. So let\u2019s take the initial state to be when the spring is compressed by a distance  x 0  and the final state to be when the object is at its maximum height. In both of these states, the velocity is equal to zero, so the kinetic energy is zero as well. Thus, as a consequence of the work-kinetic energy theorem, we know that the total work done on the object during its path must be equal to zero. We choose the positive  \u02c6 x  direction to point to the left since it is the direction of motion. The motion has four stages and we need to calculate the work on the object during each: 1. Using the form of the spring force, we can calculate the work done by the spring to be W spring  = Z  0 \u2212 x 0 F spring dx  = Z  0 \u2212 x 0 ( \u2212 kx ) dx  =  1 2 kx 2 0 . (1) 2. Using the form of the friction force, we can calculate the work done by the horizontal track to be W fric  = Z  d 0 F fric dx  =  \u2212 Z  d 0 ( mg\u00b5 ( x )) dx  =  \u2212 mg Z  d 0 \u00b5 0  +  \u00b5 1 \u0010 x d \u0011 dx  =  \u2212 mgd \u0010 \u00b5 0  +   \u00b5 1 2 \u0011 . (2) 3. The work done by the normal force of the surface of the loop is zero because the normal force is always perpendicular to the surface and the object is always moving along the surface. Thus, the normal force is perpendicular to the trajectory, so the dot product of the force and the displacement is zero. 4. Using the form of the gravitational force, we can calculate the work done by gravity as the object moves to a height  h  to be W grav  =  \u2212 Z  h 0 F grav dy  =  \u2212 Z  h 0 ( mg ) dy  =  \u2212 mgh. (3) The total work done on the object is the sum of all these contributions, which must be equal to zero by the work-kinetic energy theorem. Thus, we find W  =  W spring  +  W fric  +  W grav  =  1 2 kx 2 0   \u2212 mgd \u0010 \u00b5 0  +   \u00b5 1 2 \u0011 \u2212 mgh  = 0 .

This change in momentum is related to the force of the wall on the particle   \u20d7 F wp  through the impulse, which is given by \u2206 \u20d7 p  =   \u20d7 I  = Z  t f t i \u20d7 F wp dt. (2) Since we only care about the average force (and not the details about how it changes with time), we can model the impulse as an average force applied over the same time interval according to \u20d7 I  = Z  t f t i \u20d7 F wp dt  =   \u20d7 F   avg wp   ( t f   \u2212 t i ) =  \u20d7 F   avg wp   \u2206 t, (3) where the time interval  \u2206 t  =  t f  \u2212 t i  is the time between successive particles hitting the wall. This time interval  \u2206 t  is straightforward to calculate as the particles are a distance  d  apart and travel at a constant velocity of  v .
