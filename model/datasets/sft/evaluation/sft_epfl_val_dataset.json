Using the right-hand rule to simplify the cross products (e.g. \u02c6 x  \u00d7  \u02c6 x  = 0 ), we find \u2212 MgL 2 \u02c6 z  +  3 4 LT  sin  \u03b1 \u02c6 z  = 0 \u21d2 T  =  2 Mg 3 sin  \u03b1 . (10) Plugging this result into equation (5) gives \u20d7 T  =  2 Mg 3 \u0012  \u2212 1 tan  \u03b1   \u02c6 x  + \u02c6 y \u0013 . (11) To determine the normal force, we substitute equation (10) into equations (7) and (8) to find N x  = 2 Mg 3 tan  \u03b1 (12) N y  =  Mg  \u2212 2 Mg 3 =   Mg 3   .

What acceleration do you perceive her as having? 2 Applications of Newton\u2019s second law ", "answer": "The most challenging part of this problem is understanding and determining the physical meaning of each of the quantities from our derivation in class. In this solution we will simply state the physical meanings, but these can be seen and justified through the derivation presented in class. The first thing to note is that the mass of your own car  m 1  does not matter at all in this problem. We already know the motion of your car (and importantly the motion of the reference frame it defines) and we are not interested in calculating the forces on your car. Since the cars are executing circular motion, we can define a fixed cylindrical coordinate system  F  with the origin at the center of the circular curve and the  \u02c6 z  direction defined such that  \u03c9 1  and  \u03c9 2  are both in the positive  \u02c6 z  direction. Additionally, we observe that both cars are moving with the same angular velocity, which we will call  \u20d7 \u03c9  =  \u03c9 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  =  v 1 /R 1 \u02c6 z  =  \u03c9 2 \u02c6 z  =  v 2 /R 2 \u02c6 z . Next, we can write down the general coordinate system transformation for forces between the fixed inertial reference frame  F  and a non-inertial reference frame  N  rotating with an angular velocity  \u20d7 \u03c9 1 . As derived in class, it is \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  = \u03a3 \u20d7 F F  \u2212 m 2   \u20d7 A F N  \u2212 2 m 2 \u20d7 \u03c9 1  \u00d7  \u20d7 v N  \u2212 m 2 \u20d7 \u03b1 1  \u00d7  \u20d7 r N  \u2212 m 2 \u20d7 \u03c9 1  \u00d7  ( \u20d7 \u03c9 1  \u00d7  \u20d7 r N )  . (1) Here  \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  is the sum of the forces acting on your friend\u2019s car, as perceived in the non-inertial reference frame N  (in this case defined by the motion of your car). This is what we want to determine in order to solve the problem. The quantity  \u03a3 \u20d7 F F  is the sum of the standard forces acting on your friend\u2019s car in the fixed inertial reference frame  F  (i.e. someone standing at the center of the curve watching the cars drive by). In  the inertial reference frame, your friend\u2019s car is moving with uniform circular motion of radius  R 2 , so the sum of the forces acting on them must be a centripetal force \u03a3 \u20d7 F F  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 2 R 2 \u02c6 \u03c1. (2) In practice this would be provided by the static friction force between the car tires and the road. Note that all the masses that appear are  m 2  because we are only considering the forces acting on your friend\u2019s car, which has mass  m 2 . The rest of the terms represent fictitious forces. The first is the translational acceleration fictitious force. The quantity   \u20d7 A F N  is the acceleration of the reference frame  N , as seen from the fixed frame  F . Since the reference frame  N  is defined by your car and you are executing uniform circular motion in frame  F , we know that the acceleration must be centripetal \u20d7 A F N  =  \u2212 \u03c9 2 1 R 1 \u02c6 \u03c1. (3) Note that the angular speed and radius are that of  your  car (i.e.  \u03c9 1  and  R 1 ). The next term is the Coriolis force, which includes the velocity of your friend\u2019s car  \u20d7 v N  as seen by you in frame N . Intuitively, since both cars are traveling with the same angular velocity  \u03c9 1  =  \u03c9 2 , from your perspective your friend\u2019s car is staying stationary beside you. Her position relative to you would be a constant vector pointing outwards \u20d7 r N  = ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1. (4) Then, taking a derivative in time justifies our intuitive argument that \u20d7 v N  = 0 . (5) Note, in this step we have considered the unit vectors to be constant as we are determining how the position changes with time from the perspective of you within the reference frame  N . In other words, from your perspective facing forwards in your car (i.e. continuously facing in the   \u02c6 \u03d5  direction) and believing yourself to be at rest, your friend\u2019s position is not changing with time. Thus, the Coriolis force is zero. The next term is the Euler force, where  \u20d7 \u03b1 1  = \u02d9 \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  is the angular acceleration of reference frame  N . Since you are driving at a constant speed,  \u02d9 \u03c9 1  = 0 , so  \u20d7 \u03b1 1  = 0  and the Euler force disappears. The final term is the centrifugal force, where we have already determined that the position of your friend\u2019s car from your perspective in frame  N  is given by equation (4). Thus, the centrifugal force is non-zero and equation (4) can be substituted into equation (1). Collecting all of the results from above, we can rewrite equation (1) as \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 2 R 2 \u02c6 \u03c1  +  m 2 \u03c9 2 1 R 1 \u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  \u00d7  ( \u03c9 1 \u02c6 z  \u00d7  ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1 )  . (6) Using the fact that  \u03c9  =  \u03c9 1  =  \u03c9 2  and taking the scalars out in front of the cross products allows us to simplify to \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 z  \u00d7  (\u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u02c6 \u03c1 )  . (7) In the right-handed  ( \u03c1, \u03d5, z )  coordinate system, we can use the right hand rule to see that  \u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u02c6 \u03c1  =  \u02c6 \u03d5  and \u02c6 z  \u00d7  (\u02c6 z  \u00d7  \u02c6 \u03c1 ) = \u02c6 z  \u00d7   \u02c6 \u03d5  =  \u2212 \u02c6 \u03c1 , so \u03a3 \u20d7 F N  =  \u2212 m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1  +  m 2 \u03c9 2 ( R 2  \u2212 R 1 )\u02c6 \u03c1  = 0 . (8) Thus, from your perspective in the non-inertial reference frame  N  of your car, you see no net force acting on your friend\u2019s car. This differs from a fixed reference frame  F , in which you would observe a physical centripetal force (provided by static friction between your friend\u2019s car and the road) as given by equation (2). The lack of a net force in frame  N  arises from a cancellation between the physical centripetal force, the translational acceleration fictitious force, and the centrifugal fictitious force.  Since the net force is zero, Newton\u2019s first or second laws tells us that the acceleration  \u20d7 a N  is zero. Newton\u2019s first and second laws (but not the third) are still valid in non-inertial reference frames, as long as all of the fictitious forces are properly included. Alternatively,  \u20d7 a N  = 0  can be seen by taking the time derivative of equation (5).

Conservation of momentum in one dimension is m1 v1i  +  m2 v2i  =  m1 v1f  +  m2 v2f , (1) where the subscripts  i  and  f  indicate the state just before and just after the collision respectively and the subscripts  1  and  2  indicate the first or second ball respectively. Since the first ball has an initial speed of  v1i  =  v 0  and the second ball starts at rest  v2i  = 0 , equation (1) becomes m1 * v0  =  m1 *v1f  +  m2 *v2f . (2) Solving this equation for the final velocity of the first ball gives v1f  =  v0  - m2 / m1 *v2f . (3) We chose to solve for  v1f , rather than  v 2 f  because we are searching for  v 2 f  and substituting equation (3) into the conservation of energy equation will allow us to eliminate  v 1 f . Since the collision is elastic, mechanical energy is conserved during the collision and we can write m1 / 2  * v1i^2   +  m2/2   v2i^2   =  m1/2  * v1f^2   +  m2 / 2  * v2f^2.

Given that it is the maximum height, we know that  K 2 max  = 0 . Additionally, we can define the reference point for the gravitational potential to be at the height of the collision. Thus,  U 2 f  = 0 , implying that equation (12) becomes K 2 f  + 0 = 0 +  U 2 max \u21d2 (m1 +m2)/2  * vf^2   = (m1+m2)/ 2 gh max \u21d2 h max  =  1/2g * vf^2 .

", "answer": "The initial speed of the projectile is equal to the magnitude of its escape velocity. Given the definition of escape velocity, this can be found from the condition that K 0  +  U G 0  = 0 , (1) where the subscript  0  indicates the initial value and  U G  indicates the general gravitational potential (which is distinct from the gravitational potential near the earth\u2019s surface  U g  =  mgy ). We can calculate U G  from the form of the gravitational force between the two objects \u20d7 F G ( r ) =  \u2212 GmM e r 2 \u02c6 r. (2) Choosing to use a spherical coordinate system, the change in the potential energy due to the force   \u20d7 F G is \u2206 U G  =  U G ( R )  \u2212 U G ( \u221e ) =  \u2212 Z C \u20d7 F G  \u00b7  d \u20d7 l  =  \u2212 Z C \u0012 \u2212 GmM e r 2 \u02c6 r \u0013 \u00b7 \u0010 dr \u02c6 r  +  rd\u03b8 \u02c6 \u03b8  +  r  sin  \u03b8d\u03d5 \u02c6 \u03d5 \u0011 = Z C \u0012 GmM e r 2 \u0013 dr, (3) where the integration path  C  is along any path from  r  =  \u221e to  r  =  R . However, we see that, since the force is purely radial, only the change in radial position matters. Thus, we can write \u2206 U G  =  U G ( R )  \u2212 U G ( \u221e ) = Z  R \u221e GmM e r 2 dr. (4) Taking the integral gives a potential energy difference of \u2206 U G  =  U G ( R )  \u2212 U G ( \u221e ) = \u0012 \u2212 GmM e r \f \f \f \f R \u221e =  \u2212 GmM e R . (5) Since the reference point for the potential energy is at  R  =  \u221e (i.e. we define the potential energy such that  U ( \u221e ) = 0 ), equation (5) implies that U G ( R ) =  \u2212 GmM e R . (6) Substituting this into equation (1) allows us to find the initial speed of the projectile when it is launched m 2   v 2 0   \u2212 GmM e R e = 0 \u21d2 v 0  = r 2 GM e R e , (7) where  R  =  R e  is the initial position. 2. Since all the forces are conservative, mechanical energy is conserved and we have K c  +  U Gc  =  K 0  +  U G 0 , (8) where the subscript  c  indicates the value just before the collision. Therefore, we can use equations (1) and (6) to write equation (8) as K c  +  U Gc  = 0 \u21d2 m 2   v 2 c   \u2212 GmM e 2 R e = 0 \u21d2 v c  = r GM e R e (9) at the location just before the collision  R c  = 2 R e . 10 3. Drawing a free body diagram for the satellite and using the gravitational force given by equation (2), we see that Newton\u2019s second law in the  \u02c6 r  direction is \u2212 GmM e (2 R e ) 2  =  \u2212 m \u0012  v 2 s 2 R e \u0013 , (10) where we have used the form of the centripetal acceleration and  v s  is the speed of the satellite. Solving this equation for the speed gives v s  = r GM e 2 R e . (11) 4. Given the the collision happens quickly, we can use the impulse approximation to ignore the effect of gravity  during  the collision. Thus, momentum is conserved throughout the collision, so we can write m\u20d7 v pi  +  m\u20d7 v si  =  m\u20d7 v pf  +  m\u20d7 v sf \u21d2 \u20d7 v pi  +  \u20d7 v si  =  \u20d7 v pf  +  \u20d7 v sf , (12) where the subscript  p  indicates the projectile, the subscript  s  indicates the satellite, the subscript i  indicates the value just before the collision, and the subscript  f  indicates the value just after the collision. Since the collision is purely inelastic and the objects stick together, instead of conservation of energy, we require that the final velocities of the projectile and satellite be the same \u20d7 v pf  =  \u20d7 v sf  =  \u20d7 v f . (13) We will adopt a polar coordinate system, such that the projectile is moving in the  \u02c6 r  direction before the collision and the satellite is moving in the   \u02c6 \u03d5  direction before the collision.

A point mass of mass  m  (representing the body of the car) moves forwards with a constant horizontal velocity  v x . The mass is connected to a spring with spring constant  k  and equilibrium length  \u2113 0  (representing the shocks of the car). At the end of the spring, there is a massless wheel (representing a wheel of the car) with a negligibly small radius relative to the the other distances in the problem. The road has the shape of a cosine with bumps of height  H  and length  L  and at time  t  = 0  the wheel drops into the first bump (as shown below). Assume that the mass, spring, and wheel remain perfectly upright throughout the entire process. m k v x H L 1. Express the vertical position of the wheel as a function of time. 2. Using this information, deduce the equation of motion in the vertical direction for the body of the car. 3. Solve this equation to find the amplitude of vertical oscillations of the body of the car that are caused by the bumps. Under which conditions would your ride be the  least  comfortable? ", "answer": "We choose to use a Cartesian coordinate system with  \u02c6 x  in the direction of travel of the car and  \u02c6 y  pointing upwards. 1. We are told that the road has a cosine height profile given by y r ( x ) =  C 1  cos ( C 2 x )  , (1) where  C 1  and  C 2  are unknown constants that we must determine from the geometry of the road. Note that, by taking the form of equation (1), we are implicitly choosing the  y  location of the origin to be halfway between the top and bottom of the bumps.  C 1  quantifies the height of the bumps. Since the maximum and minimum of the cosine function are  1  and  \u2212 1  respectively, the total change in elevation 6 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 of equation (1) is  2 C 1 . Since the physical change in elevation (from trough to peak) is  H , we have H  = 2 C 1 , which implies that C 1  =   H 2   . (2) Next, we see that  C 2  quantifies the length of the bump. From the problem statement, we know that, if you are at the peak of a bump, you will arrive at the next peak by traveling a horizontal distance  L . Similarly, if you are at a maximum of the cosine function, you will find the next maximum by increasing the argument of the cosine function by  2 \u03c0  (as the cosine function is  2 \u03c0  periodic). We must choose  C 2 such that these two periodic behaviors correspond to one another. Thus, if  x  =  L  the argument of the cosine function should be  2 \u03c0 . Looking at equation (1), this means that  2 \u03c0  =  C 2 L  and we find C 2  =  2 \u03c0 L  . (3) Substituting equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) gives the shape of the road in terms of known parameters y r ( x ) =   H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  x \u0013 . (4) The wheel has a negligibly small radius, so its trajectory is the same as the road\u2019s y w ( x ) =  y r ( x ) =   H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  x \u0013 . (5) We know that the body of the car moves forwards with a constant horizontal velocity of  v x , so the wheel must as well (otherwise the car would be torn apart). Since the velocity is constant we know that the horizontal position of the wheel is just x ( t ) =  v x t  +  x 0  =  v x t, (6) where we have taken the  x  loction of the origin to be the location of the wheel at  t  = 0  so that  x 0  = 0 . This allows us to replace the  x  coordinate in equation (5) to find the vertical position of the wheel as a function of time y w ( t ) =   H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  v x t \u0013 . (7) 2. The equation of motion for the car comes from Newton\u2019s second law \u20d7 F net  =   \u20d7 F g  +   \u20d7 F s  =  m\u20d7 a c , (8) where \u20d7 F g  =  \u2212 mg \u02c6 y (9) is the gravitational force, \u20d7 F s  =  \u2212 k \u2206 y \u02c6 y (10) is the spring force, and the  c  subscript indicates it refers to the body of the car. The challenge is to determine  \u2206 y , the extension of the spring relative to its equilibrium length. First, we will let  y c  denote the height of the car, which is a function of time. From the picture in the problem statement, we see that, at any instant, the length of the spring will be  \u2113 =  y c  \u2212 y w . Given that the equilibrium length is \u2113 0 , we have that \u2206 y  =  \u2113 \u2212 \u2113 0  =  y c  \u2212 y w  \u2212 \u2113 0 . (11) Substituting equations (9), (10), and (11) into the  \u02c6 y  component of equation (8) gives \u2212 mg  \u2212 k \u2206 y  =  ma c \u21d2 \u2212 mg  \u2212 k  ( y c  \u2212 y w  \u2212 \u2113 0 ) =  m d 2 y c dt 2  . (12) 7 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 Substituting equation (7) from part 1 yields \u2212 mg  \u2212 k \u0012 y c  \u2212 H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  v x t \u0013 \u2212 \u2113 0 \u0013 =  m d 2 y c dt 2  . (13) Rearranging we can isolate the inhomogeneous terms on the right side and arrive at the equation of motion d 2 y c dt 2  +  k m y c  =  k m H 2  cos \u0012 2 \u03c0 L  v x t \u0013 +   k m \u2113 0  \u2212 g. (14) 3. Equation (14) is a complicated differential equation, but we can recognize it as the simple harmonic oscillator equation with the addition of forcing terms (i.e. all the terms on the right side of the equation). To attack this, we first let \u03c9 0  = r k m (15) \u03c9 d  =  2 \u03c0v x L (16) to get the simpler and more familiar form of d 2 y c dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 H 2  cos ( \u03c9 d t ) +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g. (17) You can solve this equation by looking it up in the Math Review document on the course Moodle. However, here we will show how to solve it directly. This differential equation is similar to an equation we solved in lecture 13a, but there are extra constant terms. Because these terms are constant, we can eliminate them by defining a new vertical coordinate  Y c  such that \u03c9 2 0 Y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 y c   \u2212 \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   +  g \u21d2 \u03c9 2 0 y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 Y c   +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g. (18) Taking two derivatives of this equation yields \u03c9 2 0 d 2 y c dt 2  =  \u03c9 2 0 d 2 Y c dt 2 \u21d2 d 2 y c dt 2  =  d 2 Y c dt 2  . (19) Substituting equations (18) and (19) into equation (17) gives d 2 Y c dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 Y c   +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g  =  \u03c9 2 0 H 2  cos ( \u03c9 d t ) +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g \u21d2 d 2 Y c dt 2  +  \u03c9 2 0 Y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 H 2  cos ( \u03c9 d t )  , (20) where we see that the two offending terms have been eliminated. This is now identical to the differential equation solved in lecture 13a, so long as we identify that the notation in class corresponds to  x  =  Y c , \u03bb  = 0 , and  F d /m  =  \u03c9 2 0 H/ 2 . Thus, the solution is Y c  ( t ) =  A 1 e i\u03c9 0 t   +  A 2 e \u2212 i\u03c9 0 t   +   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d cos ( \u03c9 d t )  . (21) We can find the solution for the original vertical coordinate by substituting equations (15) and (21) into equation (18) to get \u03c9 2 0 y c   =  \u03c9 2 0 \u0012 A 1 e i\u03c9 0 t   +  A 2 e \u2212 i\u03c9 0 t   +   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d cos ( \u03c9 d t ) \u0013 +  \u03c9 2 0 \u2113 0   \u2212 g \u21d2 y c  ( t ) =  A 1 e i\u03c9 0 t   +  A 2 e \u2212 i\u03c9 0 t   +   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d cos ( \u03c9 d t ) +  \u2113 0  \u2212 mg k  , (22) 8 Harmonic motion and gyroscopes - 13 where  A 1  and  A 2  are integration constants that are determined by the initial conditions. This is the full solution to the differential equation of equation (14). Note that the first two terms correspond to oscillation, which can be seen through applying Euler\u2019s formula  exp( ix ) = cos( x ) +  i  sin( x )  . However, this oscillation occurs at the natural angular frequency  \u03c9 0  of the system and is independent of the characteristics of the bumps. This oscillation would occur on flat ground, if the body of the car was displaced a bit vertically. The problem statement asks us about the oscillations caused by the bumps. These are represented by the third term, which we see depends on the height of the bumps as well as their length (through equation (16)). Studying this term, we can see that the amplitude of the vertical oscillations caused by the bumps is \u2206 y c  =   H 2 \u03c9 2 0 \u03c9 2 0   \u2212 \u03c9 2 d . (23) Thus, the ride would be least comfortable when  \u03c9 2 d   =  \u03c9 2 0   because the amplitude of the vertical oscillation would become infinite, which represents resonance. This condition is equivalent to \u03c9 2 0   =  \u03c9 2 d \u21d2 k m   = \u0012 2 \u03c0v x L \u0013 2 \u21d2 v x  =   L 2 \u03c0 r k m (24) and satisfying it for an extended period of time might cause damage to the car.
