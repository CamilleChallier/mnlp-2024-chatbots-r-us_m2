{"chosen":"There are several reasons why eating raw seafood is generally considered safe while eating raw land animal produce is not. One reason is that raw land animals, such as chickens and pork, host more toxic bacteria, such as Salmonella, E. coli, worms, and even the hepatitis E virus, than fish do. [1] This is because the kinds of parasites and bacteria crawling around raw land animals are more toxic to humans than those found in fish. [1] Cooking the meat at a high temperature helps kill off these bacteria, but it is not always possible to do this without ruining the texture of the meat. [2] The other reason why raw fish is generally considered safe is that the raw meat from certain animals, such as fish, oysters, and mussels, contain fewer pathogens than other types of raw meat. This is because eating raw meat depends on several factors, including preparation, hygiene conditions, the source of the meat, and the species of the animal.

In some cultures, however, the term may be used to refer to benign, positive, or neutral metaphysical practices, such as divination, meditation, or self-help techniques found in the modern Pagan and New Age movements [2]. Historically, witches were human magic-makers who used folklore, nature, and old, deeply-felt superstitions and practices to change or influence events [3]. The Christian church was convinced that these beliefs were associated with the devil and attacked the mere suspicion of them with extreme brutality [3]. For the next 300 years, hundreds of thousands of people were tortured and executed [3]. More recently, witchcraft has come to be associated with a different stereotype--that of a bunch of crones who meet secretly at night, indulge in cannibalism and orgiastic rites with the Devil, or Satan, and perform black magic [4].","prompt":"Can someone please explain witch craft to me in detail?"}

Less work equals better fuel economy [2][3]. Essentially, it's fine to use this button whenever you're driving on flat terrain but if you're driving up a steep hill it may be best to turn it off [2][4]. The reason for this is because it causes the Camry's engine to work harder [4]. Having the O\/D off is also useful in snowy conditions to gain more traction [4].

Older automatic transmissions controlled this automatically but often still had a button to switch off the overdrive.  Overdrive in older cars electronically engaged an extra gear on the output shaft of the transmission to let you drive at lower RPMs but higher speeds.  Older gearboxes often had the highest gear as a 1:1 ratio, which caused the engine to rev a lot at higher speeds. These gearboxes often had 3 or 4 gears, and instead of rebuilding the whole gearbox for more gears, they installed an extra overdrive unit on the rear of the transmission.  In modern vehicles, the overdrive gear is often referred to as gears with a ratio lower than 1:1, which is often the highest gear or the two highest gears.

The syrup and carbonated water mix together and exit out of the nozzle, which is activated when the customer pushes down on a lever [3]. You just inject new CO2 gas into the bottle to re-carbonate your soda [1, 2]. Soda dispensers also use CO2 to keep soda carbonated [4]. The mounting style of a soda dispenser refers to more than just how the machine is installed [4].

The US monopoly on helium caused a shortage, forcing others to turn to using highly-flammable hydrogen as their lifting gas [1]. Helium is the second-most abundant element in the known universe, but it's hard to capture on Earth because of how easily it floats out of the atmosphere and into space [3]. Oil companies harvest helium that is dispersed from uranium rock and is trapped in natural gas chambers deep under the Earth's surface [3]. Finding the helium can be challenging, and the US has been the largest producer of helium since 1925, thanks to a massive reserve found across Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas \u2014 fittingly named the Federal Helium Reserve [4]. This reserve will close down production in 2021, and scientists are looking for new reserves to replace it [4]. The Helium Privatization Act of 1996 required the US government to sell off its supply of helium by 2015, leading to the rapid sale of much of the gas [5].","prompt":"The Helium Shortage\n\nWhat is causing the shortage?

This would have required New Horizons to launch with nearly 70,000 pounds of fuel, which was not feasible. [1] Furthermore, the brief encounter was a product of the realities of orbital physics, which precluded any chance to slow down the spacecraft.

Above this is a thick layer of gas, with thousands of kilometers of thickness. The concentration of gas is increasing as you get closer to the core, but it is not solid [2]. This means that ground vehicles cannot be placed on these planets, but gliders would be effective in the atmosphere of these planets [2].

No single design can optimize all of these sciences, but rather there exist compromised designs that incorporate the vehicle specifications, available technology, and economic feasibility [3]. The Cold War was in full gear, and the potential technological and strategic advantages such a feat would give the Russians was a concern. As a result, the Space Race was really a proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union [4]. After the 1969 Moon landing, the sense of urgency that drove the project evaporated [5].

[1] Cling film is a thin sheet of either PVC or low-density polyethylene, and its long, coiled-up molecules give it some stretch, allowing it to be pulled taut over plates or bowls. [1, 2] Separating the top layer of film from the roll tears electrons away from the atoms of either surface, leaving areas that have lost electrons with a positive charge, and patches that have gained electrons with a negative charge. [1]  The tight molecular bond and spring-like quality of the chains are why plastic wrap made from these polymers sticks really well and does a good job of blocking moisture and odors.

When you wrap the clingfilm around itself or another insulator (like glass) the electrostatic charge induces an opposite charge in the other surface and the two stick together [2,3]. The act of peeling plastic wrap off a roll (heaven help you if you lose the end of the film in the wrinkles on the roll), you create a static charge [4].

The first reason is public safety: hunting and gun-owning licenses prevent dangerous individuals from easily acquiring deadly force weapons. Permits and hunting boundaries can prevent hunters from getting too close to public areas, or shooting other hunters. [2] The second reason is conservation: regulations on what animals you can hunt, and how many you can kill, are all about the conservation of natural resources and protecting the delicate ecosystems of our wilderness. Deforestation, pollution, forest fires, and population decline are all consequences. [2, 3] Hunters are also required to have permits because they must purchase and own their weapons and follow certain regulations regarding weapon types.

Hunting continues to be the most effective, cost efficient and socially acceptable method of population control. [4]","rejected":"Hunting regulations are in place to manage animal populations and protect the delicate ecosystems of our wilderness [1]. There are several factors that go into determining hunting season dates and regulations, including breeding, nesting, age and gender distribution, and economic concerns [4]. For instance, if an animal population is too large, regulators will time it to give hunters a greater advantage in the harvest [4]. If the population is shrinking, they'll set the dates to give the animals a greater survival advantage [4].

Additionally, federal energy standards and the Energy Star program require dishwashers to use less water and energy [2]. As a result, dishwashers today take more than three hours to complete a normal cycle [2]. However, some newer dishwashers claim to wash either a fully soiled load or, more commonly, a lightly soiled one [2].  There are also technical reasons why home dishwashers take longer. Dishwashers today are designed to use hotter water than previously designed models, and some models internally heat the water during the wash cycle, and sometimes during the prewash, and often during the final rinse to facilitate drying, which all increases cycle times [3].

After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key attributes of any star, like its mass or its composition. To calculate a star\u2019s mass, just look it its orbital period and do a bit of algebra. To determine what it\u2019s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits [3].

For example, here's a portion of the spectrum of Arcturus [3]. Now, different stars have spectra which look very different [3]. In the nineteen-twenteties, Cecilia Payne studied the spectra of stars, and devised a way to figure out the temperature and true chemical composition of stars [4]. She concluded that the atmospheres of stars were not made up of the same mix of elements as the Earth were not wildly variable in composition, but in fact almost entirely hydrogen, in almost all stars [4]. This was so surprising that scientists ignored or rejected the idea for several years. Eventually, after further study confirmed Payne's work, the astronomical community had to concede that the stars were, in fact, very different from the Earth. They appeared to be made up of 90% hydrogen, 10% helium, and tiny traces of heavy elements (everything else) [4].","prompt":"How do we know the chemical composition of stars that are so far away?\n\nDo we know these things as fact?

One technique is RDP hacking, which is when a hacker uses a vulnerability in the RDP connection to access a system [1,2]. Once a hacker has gained access to a computer through RDP, they can use the computer to search for and exploit additional vulnerabilities in the network [2]. Another method hackers use is social engineering; this is when a hacker tricks someone into giving them access to a computer or network [3]. Hackers can also use local exploit tools to obtain sensitive information from a computer or network, such as configuration errors and known vulnerabilities of the operating system [3].","rejected":"The first thing a hacker will do is gather as much information about the target as possible.

{"chosen":"The reason that cells do not combine is because their phospholipid membranes are usually negatively charged and so the phosphate groups repelled each other by like charges. Membranes are also full of proteins and often coated with carbohydrates, which serve to keep membranes from interacting too strongly. [1] Phospholipids are composed of a number of components including two fatty acids, a glycerol unit, a phosphate group, and a polar molecule. The polar region (head) in the phosphate group of a phospholipid is attracted to water. The fatty acid tail is repelled by water. [3]  Additionally, the energy barrier for flipping a lipid in a bilayer is pretty high, since the polar head group doesn't like passing through the hydrophobic layer. Bringing two membranes together would require overcoming the charge-charge repulsion and flipping around the inner two layers of lipids.

The bilayer is also full of proteins and often coated with carbohydrates, which serve to keep the membranes from interacting too strongly [1]. Furthermore, because of the chemical and structural nature of the phospholipid bilayer (hydrophobic core), only lipid-soluble molecules and some small molecules are able to freely pass through the lipid bilayer [3]. Ions and large polar molecules are unable to pass through the lipid bilayer, so these require the aid of membrane transport proteins in order to cross the membrane [3].

Other workers might be hired to cover reservists in private-sector jobs who get sent overseas. With the unemployment rate down, more people are spending again and people who had jobs before will be less worried about losing their jobs, so they'll spend more than they did.

A sheet of stratus clouds covering the sky \u2013 called opacus \u2013 also naturally blocks sunlight and takes on a gray cast.  [1]  Clouds that are about to rain are dark because the clouds are starting to get denser with droplets, and as a result, droplets are combining and growing bigger.

Once they've completed the software and certification processes the terminal will then undergo a certification process with each of the card networks, which is typically a lengthy process that takes place in stages [1, 2]. Since specifications for EMV debit card processing came late, some merchants in the payments industry delayed their conversion work to support EMV for credit cards [3].

Plants get their color from pigments that they produce, and these pigments can selectively absorb or reflect certain wavelengths of light, causing a plant to appear a certain color [1]. Most chlorophylls absorb red and blue wavelength light, mostly reflecting green wavelengths, which is why most plants appear green to our eyes [2, 4]. Flowers may not contain chlorophyll, however, or other pigments may cover up the green pigment, masking its color [4]. Another reason why flowers might not be green is that not all plants use photosynthesis to generate energy. Heterotrophs, or \"other feeders,\" cannot make their own food and will either obtain nutrients from other plants or feed on fungi [4]. Since green is not the only color of chlorophyll, some plants may appear yellow, red, or another color rather than green [2].","rejected":"One of the main reasons that green is the predominant color of terrestrial plants is that chlorophyll, the chemical that makes plants green, absorbs light from the sun to use as energy in a process called photosynthesis [1, 2, 3, 5].

Chlorophyll is able to absorb all the colors of light except green, which bounces off the leaf and is what we actually see when we look at a green plant [3, 6]. Another theory is that early in the evolution of life on earth, there were purple bacteria called archaea that used a light-sensitive molecule called retinol to absorb green light and reflect red and violet light [4]. This would have made parts of the earth look purple, as green light was \"taken\" by archaea.

This is because, as you likely know, volcanoes erupt when the pressure of magma increases to such a level that the surrounding rock fragments and collapses, causing the magma to rush out onto the surface [1]. If you plug up the volcano's conduit, the magma will build up pressure until it is eventually dislodged, causing an explosive eruption with greater force than normal [2]. If the plug is good enough to withstand that pressure, the volcano will still explode out of its sides because it cannot erupt out its vent [3]. In addition, volcanic plugs and necks tend to be more resistant to erosion than their enclosing rock formations, allowing them to stand out in relief after the volcano becomes inactive [4].","rejected":"There are three basic reasons that volcanoes cannot be sealed off. First, the conduit through which magma travels to escape the volcano is typically very thin, and it is easy for magma to force its way through even a small opening [1, 3]. Second, even if the magma could be kept from escaping the volcano, the resulting pressure build up would eventually force magma to escape the volcano in powerful eruptions that would be even more dangerous than normal [1, 3]. Finally, if magma cannot escape the volcano, the volcano will erupt from its sides, as happened at Mount St. Helens [4]. These eruptions can also be more dangerous than normal because their paths are less predictable.","prompt":"Why can't we just \"seal\" active volcano craters to stop them?\n\nNot talking about explosive ones, but the ones that just hold a lot of lava in the crater.

Blood fluid volume decreases, making the heart work harder to pump the proper amount of nutrients, oxygen, and fluid to different cells, causing fatigue.

When you are low on fluids, your body may feel tired and weaker than usual [1]. Consuming a sufficient amount of fluids in beverages and water-filled food can help address this issue [1].","prompt":"What role does hydration play in being tired?"}
{"chosen":"Atomic clocks work by incorporating the oscillations of atoms into the gears that help keep time [1]. These oscillations have a much higher frequency than traditional clocks and are much more stable [1]. An atomic clock is made up of several components [2]. Inside the cesium ion atomic clock, cesium atoms are funneled down a tube where they pass through radio waves [2]. If the frequency of the radio waves is just right, then the cesium atoms will \"resonate\" and change their energy state [2]. A detector at the end of the tube keeps track of the number of cesium atoms striking it that have changed their energy state [2]. The more finely tuned the radio wave frequency is, the more cesium atoms will reach the detector [2]. The detector feeds information back into the radio wave generator, which then synchronizes the frequency of the radio waves with the peak number of cesium atoms striking it [2]. A second is ticked off when the frequency count is met [2].","rejected":"An atomic clock is a clock that uses the resonance frequencies of atoms as its resonator [4]. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, the resonator is \"regulated by the frequency of the microwave electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by the quantum transition (energy change) of an atom or molecule\" [4].

According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, an atomic clock is a clock that \"uses the resonance frequencies of atoms as its resonator\" [4].\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that atoms resonate at extremely consistent frequencies. If you take any atom of cesium and ask it to resonate, it will resonate at exactly the same frequency as any other atom of cesium [4]. Cesium-133 oscillates at 9,192,631,770 cycles per second [4]. This sort of accuracy is completely different from the accuracy of a quartz clock [4]. In a quartz clock, the quartz crystal is manufactured so that its oscillating frequency is extremely consistent [4].","prompt":"How do a Atomic Clock works?"}

Returning to play after an injury can be difficult for athletes, and a sports psychologist can help injured athletes cope better with the pressures associated with returning to a prior level of performance [2]. As part of mental preparation, a sports psychologist also helps athletes develop mental skills used during pregame or prerace routines, and teaches athletes how to focus on the process instead of results and be more proactive with their confidence prior to competition [1, 3].

{"chosen":"The explanation for \"no hot water left to shower\" usually comes from a situation where a person has a water heater that does not have an on-demand water heater and the hot water for showers comes from the water heater tank [1].  Because of the nature of water heaters, it can take some time for the water within the tank to reach the desired temperature, and if other members of the household have taken showers, washed laundry, or run the dishwasher, they may have used all the available hot water [2].  Furthermore, many water heaters only actively run for an average of roughly 3 hours a day and the newer, energy-efficient models run even less than that [3]. \n\nThere are also other reasons why a person could run out of hot water too quickly. For example, multiple appliances using hot water running simultaneously or perhaps a hot water heater with a timer that is set to save energy [4].","rejected":"The topic of hot water running out during a shower is usually due to a water heater with sediment buildup [1].

Large families will need a bigger water heater tank than someone living alone [2]. The issue could also be due to taking showers back to back, which can drain the hot water from the tank [3]. The water heater temperature should be a minimum of 120 degrees to prevent diseases, but no more than 140 degrees to prevent scalding [4].

Laser dentistry is another way to fix cavities; lasers zap cavities with an invisible light beam and are very conservative and precise, allowing a filling to be placed there [4].

[1] For instance, ground-breaking research from a team of evolutionary biologists at Indiana University has shown that asexual species are not doomed to extinction simply from a long, slow accumulation of new mutations. Rather, it is fast-paced gene conversion processes that expose pre-existing deleterious recessive mutations. [2] These processes may lead to asexual species going extinct fairly rapidly.

Objects that tensors may map between include vectors and scalars [1]. Tensors have become important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems [2,3,4,5]. In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another [3]. This leads to the concept of a tensor field [3]. A tensor may be defined at a single point or a collection of isolated points of space or over a continuum of points [4,5]. In the latter case, the elements of the tensor are functions of position and the tensor forms what is called a tensor field [5].","rejected":"In mathematics, a tensor is an algebraic object that describes a multilinear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space.

{"chosen":"There are several reasons that birds are able to stay warm even when temperatures are cold. First, birds are warm-blooded like us, but some species will let their body temperatures drop overnight to save energy [1, 2]. According to the National Audubon Society, black-capped chickadees can lower their internal thermostats by as much as 22\u00baF after dark [1]. Another cool physiological adaptation is that birds will \"shiver,\" but not like us. They activate and contract opposing muscles, which helps retain heat without actually moving around too much [1]. Ducks and other waterfowl have a counter-current heat exchange system in their legs that helps to keep their webbed feet from freezing [1, 2]. Their blood circulates more effectively and they can even minimize circulation in their extremities (i.e., the parts closest to the ice and snow) and prioritize blood flow around vital organs [2]. Additionally, no muscles at all on their lower legs and feet mean they hardly need more than a pitter-patter of blood to do what they need to do [2]. Overall, birds are able to stay warm in the winter because of several biological tricks [1, 2]. ","rejected":"Birds, like humans, are warm blooded, so they have many ways to stay warm, including seeking shelter from the elements and huddling together to share warmth [1]. Some birds, like sparrows, also seek out cavities to avoid the elements [1]. Cardinals, smaller birds, and black-capped chickadees and other species puff up into a round shape to minimize heat loss [1]. Gulls can stand on ice with feet at near-freezing temperatures, while their body's core remains warm [2]. Hummingbirds undergo torpor nightly, lowering their body temperature as much as 22 degrees Fahrenheit [3].","prompt":"How is it possible that the little birds are not all frozen solid right now?\n\nIt's hard for me to believe that a little ball of fuzz can keep a little bird from becoming a chunk of ice.

{"chosen":"To calculate the cost of a natural disaster, you must first determine the losses. Losses can be direct or indirect. Direct losses are physical destruction of buildings, crops, and natural resources. Indirect losses consist of temporary unemployment and business interruption [2]. The cost of a natural disaster is typically defined as cash payouts by insurers and governments to reimburse some (and in certain cases all) of the losses suffered by individuals and businesses [2]. However, losses suffered by those who are uninsured, those whose losses do not make them eligible for insurance payments, and those who do not receive government relief should be counted in any complete compilation of the impacts of a disaster - but these losses are not included as \"costs,\" as that term is used in this report [2].

EMDAT is the only public database on disaster costs with worldwide coverage [2]. This data is divided into mortality, morbidity, and financial losses [2]. The trends indicated by each of these measures pose a problem for any attempt to characterise trends in disaster impact and use those trends to identify optimal policy choices [2]. Insurers use the results of catastrophe models as one input into pricing policies [3]. A policy is a contract between an insurer and the insured that requires the insurer to pay claims on the policy [3].

Another variant discovered by the CCMB team, rs1426654-A, can override the skin lightening effect of the previous gene, making skin darker [2, 4].

{"chosen":"Laundry detergent contains surfactants, which are molecules that have a hydrophilic, or water-attracting, head and a hydrophobic, or grease-attracting, tail [1][2]. When a piece of clothing is immersed in water with detergents containing surfactants, the hydrophobic tail of the surfactant molecules attach to the grease, and the hydrophilic head end of the molecule is attracted to the water [2]. When the washing machine agitates the clothes, the molecules form tiny spheres, which stay suspended in the water and are rinsed away when the water is drained [2]. This means that the surfactants help draw grime out of clothing while making sure it doesn't return to the fabrics [2].","rejected":"Laundry detergent works by combining various ingredients to help break up and suspend stains and dirt [2]. Some of these ingredients include builders that remove calcium and magnesium ions in hard water, allowing anionic surfactants to more effectively bind to grime [1, 4]. Other ingredients, like alkalies, combine with acid to neutralize it and remove stains and dirt from fabrics [3]. However, there are some downsides to these ingredients. For instance, builders can make the surfactants in laundry detergent less effective in removing grime in water that is hard due to the excess positive ions [1, 4]. In addition, the anionic surfactants in laundry detergent do not work well in water that has a lot of minerals, like calcium and magnesium [4].","prompt":"Why doesn't the dye in colored laundry detergent stain the clothes you wash with it?\n\n"}

This theory proposes that people's willingness to accept rules and engage in a particular activity is influenced by their level of motivational activation, or their degree of excitement and engagement. [1] According to the MAM, engagement leads to increased enjoyment following violent game play, which in turn predicts increased state aggression. Motivational activation, in turn, influences engagement, state aggression, and frustration, which negatively affects enjoyment. [1] A number of studies have found that playing violent video games increases aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, both in the short term and the long term. For example, in a longitudinal study, researchers found that young people who played violent video games were more likely to be bullies, a risk factor for more serious violent behavior. [3] Additionally, in a recent meta-analysis, 136 studies representing 130,296 participants from several countries were analyzed, and it was found that playing violent video games was associated with many measures of aggression, including self, teacher, and parent reports of aggressive behavior.

The three core concepts identified in the model are: (a) Purposeful Action, (b) Patterned Behavior, and (c) Feedback [1]. Patients' initiating and sustaining medication adherence are dependent on the deliberate decision to take medications based on perceived need, effectiveness, and safety (Purposeful Action) [1].

An alternate escape route keeps air moving and the drain line flowing at full capacity [1]. The overflow hole is aptly named, as it keeps your sink from flooding [2]. It does this by diverting water, giving you more time to act before the contents spill over [2]. A standard sink overflow is a hidden channel running along the underside of the sink basin [3].

Often, the difference is merely in the way the drug is taken- for example, a capsule or tablet- but sometimes there are actual differences in the drug itself, such as a soft gel capsule or a tablet [3, 4]. In general, tablets require time for the body to break down since they have fillers that help them harden and compress, and gel caps and chewables are easier to eat or drink for people who have difficulty swallowing [2, 3, 4]. However, some tablets can bypass the stomach due to their density, allowing them to dissolve in the intestines, where absorption also takes place [2].

The folds of the vocal cords can suffer muscle loss, becoming thinner and less pliable, resulting in a less rich, less resonant sound [1]. Furthermore, the vocal cords can become bowed and curve inward rather than vibrating tightly together, which can result in a scratchy, hoarse voice [2]. Aging may also bring a loss of flexibility to the joints of the larynx, which can become stiff, and the cartilage of the voice box can calcify [3]. The vocal cords can lose muscle tone, flexibility and elasticity, and dry out [3]. Sometimes, the muscles of the larynx can atrophy, become thinner and weaker [3]. Ribs may become more calcified, the torso can shrink, and the lungs can become smaller, stiffer and less pliable, all of which can weaken the voice [3].","rejected":"Changes to the voice can be caused by aging of the vocal mechanism.

The surfaces of planets are also lumpy and bumpy but have been pulled into a circular shape [5]. However, smaller objects like asteroids can be an irregular shape [5]. What gravity does is pull all the particles together, and the way in which the particles can arrange themselves so they are as close as they can be to each other is into a spherical shape [4].

[2] An intrauterine pressure catheter is a device placed inside the uterus to monitor uterine contractions during labor. The catheter measures the pressure within the amniotic space during contractions and allows physicians to evaluate the strength, frequency, and duration of contractions. Those measurements enable physicians to evaluate the progression of labor and intervene when contractions are too weak to properly dilate a laboring woman\u2019s cervix to successfully deliver a fetus.

General anesthetics induces a state of general insensibility to pain.  The patient loses awareness yet his vital physiologic functions, such as breathing and maintenance of blood pressure, continue to function.  Less is known about the mechanism of action of general anesthetics compared to locals, despite their use for more than 150 years. [1]  In contrast, local anesthetics block nerve transmission to pain centers in the central nervous system by binding to and inhibiting the function of an ion channel in the cell membrane of nerve cells known as the sodium channel.  This action obstructs the movement of nerve impulses near the site of injection, but there are no changes in awareness and sense perception in other areas.

[1]","rejected":"There are three main players in dark adaptation: the pupil, the cone cells, and the rod cells [1]. The iris that surrounds the pupil contains muscles that control the size of the pupil. When confronted with low light conditions, the iris expands the pupil as wide as possible, letting as much light as possible into the eye so that sensitivity is enhanced [2]. The cone cells themselves can adapt to partial darkness. Cone cells contain rhodopsin, which is one of many light-sensitive chemicals. Rhodopsin is very sensitive to light and is the primary chemical used by the cones when seeing in low light conditions [3]. However, rhodopsin is so sensitive to light that under normal light levels, the light deforms and deactivates (photobleaches) this chemical. Most of the day, when we are walking around in normal light, the rhodopsin in our eyes is deactivated. Upon exposure to darkness, the rhodopsin is able to regenerate and reactivate, becoming sensitive again to light and improving our night vision [3].","prompt":"Why can our eyes adjust so quickly to a bright environment but it takes a while to adjust to a dark one?\n\nI've got a feeling that it's based on the fact that our pupil dilates passively but constricts actively.

Data from The Washington Post shows that 23 unarmed black suspects were fatally shot by the police in 2018, while even fewer, 12, were shot in 2019 [1]. One of the reasons police are allegedly more likely to shoot unarmed black people is because of implicit biases linking blacks to crime [4].

The first six letters in the top alphabet row of a standard keyboard QWERTY go back to 1873, when Christopher Latham Sholes made improvements to his earlier typewriter models in order to design a quicker and more efficient typewriter for E. Remington and Sons [3]. As in other behaviors, it seems, humans are creatures of habit: \"With electronic keyboards, there is no need for QWERTY, but people have become accustomed to the design and that is why it continues to be used,\" explained Robert L.

The layout put commonly used letter pairings as far apart as possible to prevent keys from jamming [2]. When improvements in typewriters eliminated the problem of jamming, trials in 1932 with an efficiently laid-out keyboard showed that it would let us double our typing speed and reduce our typing effort by 95 per cent [2]. However, QWERTY keyboards were solidly entrenched by then and no changes were made [2]. As more and more competitors developed new typewriters, they realized that the cost to re-train new typists to use their keyboard layout was getting higher while the cost to simply convert their keyboard layout to QWERTY was declining [6]. Eventually, all the other typewriter companies simply started using the QWERTY layout [6].","prompt":"Why do electronic keyboards still use the \"QWERTY\" arrangement if is no longer necessary?"}

For example, when the Malaysia plane disappeared, it was over the ocean, so the transponder wasn't useful anyway and could have been turned off without anyone noticing. In addition, at some airports with surface radar movement equipment, air traffic controllers have access to the precise position of aircraft on the ground, so data from the plane's transponder is unnecessary and can make things confusing. [1] \nA pilot can also turn off the transponder in the cockpit via two switches, one on the right and the other on the left. When one transponder is on, the other is normally in standby mode.

[2]","rejected":"There are several reasons why an airplane is allowed to turn off their transponder, but there are no longer any reasons why a transponder needs to have an off switch [1, 3]. One reason is because the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires that all electrical circuits other than main circuits of starter motors used during starting only and circuits in which no hazard is presented by their omission are protected with fuses or circuit breakers [2]. In the event that an electrical issue arises during flight, the pilot may need to turn off the transponder in order to resolve the issue [1]. Another reason why the ability to turn off the transponder is still permitted is because it is a vestige of an earlier era when the FAA required that all locations of aircraft be known for ground assistance and because the transponder warns other nearby planes of their course and altitude [3]. Eventually, the FAA hopes to institute an automatic, location-based broadcasting system that neither the flight crew nor a hijacker can shut down [3].","prompt":"Why are commercial airplanes allowed\/able to turn off their transponders?"}

{"chosen":"When drinking carbonated beverages (soda, pop, etc.), the CO2 that is released reacts with the water inside your mouth, throat, and belly [1]. The resulting carbonic acid, some of which is aerosolized, can then be burped up into the nose [1]. While the nasal lining is quite sensitive and in contact with carbonic acid, it can cause a burning sensation [1, 3]. The kind of soda you drink (also called pop, soft drink or carbonated drink) can be of many different flavors, and nowadays many different kinds of drink, but it mostly refers to the group of drinks that are \"fizzy\" when you look at them and taste them [2]. The bubbles do cause some weird stuff to happen. Carbonation from beverages like soda causes two sensations, making your mouth taste sour and causing a tingling feeling in your nose and throat [3]. The burning sensation that many people feel when drinking carbonated drinks stems from nerves that respond to pain sensations and temperature in your nose and mouth [3].","rejected":"There are several reasons why a burp after drinking a carbonated drink could result in a burning sensation in the nose. Although not all carbonated drinks contain the same amount of carbon dioxide (CO2), the bubbles in all carbonated drinks are made up of CO2 infused with the water during the production process [3]. As you drink more soda, more CO2 bubbles will enter your digestive system [3]. Eventually your body will need to expel this gas, and burping is one way your body does this [3]. However, the nasal lining is quite sensitive, and when in contact with carbonic acid, can cause a burning sensation [1]. Also, if you drink soda especially quickly, you may increase the amount of air you take in while swallowing [4]. Swallowing a sufficiently large air bubble with your soda can lead to discomfort within your esophagus [4]. Finally, eating or drinking too much can also lead to gas [5]. When the stomach is full, or overfilled, it makes room by expelling gas [5]. Soda is a carbonated beverage, so a large buildup of carbon dioxide is inevitable [5].

{"chosen":"The reason HIV\/AIDS is hard to cure is that the virus can hide in the body and avoid antiretroviral drugs [4]. When HIV attacks, it incorporates itself into the DNA of the cell and hijacks the cell's internal workings to replicate itself [4]. This process allows it to make more HIV virions that will go on to attack more cells [4]. HIV also mutates at one of the fastest known rates, making it impossible to treat with a single drug [1]. Another reason why HIV infection is hard to cure is that HIV attacks the immune system itself [2]. Most viral infections would not survive the defense mechanism of the immune system, but HIV can hide in white blood cells in a patient's body for decades [3]. By the time drugs are started, a typical infected patient contains millions of these cells with latent HIV in them [3].

Another reason HIV infection is hard to cure is that HIV attacks the immune system itself [2]. The immune system, especially the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system, provide natural defense against pathogens and foreign objects such as allergens [2].

Prosthetic replacements are generally mechanical replications for lost limbs or other extremities, powered by tiny extremely high capacity battery packs, that have the ability to link into a patient\u2019s nervous system impulses to have a unit that acts much like the original in execution [3]. The technology has also come far enough to create synthetic tissues that make the Cyborg Prosthetic appear to be made of human flesh and bone [3].","rejected":"There are two types of prosthetic limbs: myoelectric and neuroprosthetic. [1][2]  Myoelectric prosthetic limbs take advantage of the electrical signals produced by your muscles during contraction.

[1]  By placing sensors on the prosthetic interface, these signals can be relayed to a control unit for decision-making.  [1]  The strength and frequency of these waves depend on the intensity with which the muscle contracts, allowing a myoelectric prosthetic to change the strength of movements based on signal amplitude.  [1]  Neuroprosthetic limbs rely on neural interfaces between the prosthetic and the human brain.  [2]  They often connect directly to nerves or bone, oftentimes requiring dedicated surgical implantation of neuronal sensors.

One way to keep your private information private is to not give it out. It\u2019s common for celebrities to have a set of contact information that is filtered by assistants, agents, and managers. This helps to put a layer of privacy between them and people trying to find out where they live, such as paparazzi or overly dedicated fans. It also decreases the likelihood of harmful gossip and other online reputation management problems, and it can keep you physically safe from strangers who might seek you out in person.

The legality of betting on horse racing varies state-by-state, but its origins date back to the 19th century when the sport first became prevalent in the US [1]. By the late 1800's, horse racing was firmly entrenched as an American institution with over 300 tracks in operation [1]. However, those opposed to gambling were able to successfully ban bookmakers at the turn of the 20th century, which led to the introduction of parimutuel wagering in 1908 [1]. The parimutuel system is the primary reason betting on horse racing is legal and has flourished [1]. In parimutuel wagering all bets of a particular type are combined into one pool, and bettors aren\u2019t vying against the \u201chouse,\u201d as the odds are determined by what their fellow bettors do (i.e. how much money is wagered on a particular horse or combination) [1].","rejected":"Betting on horse races is legal because it takes place in a pool-based system separate from sports.

The psychoacoustic science is used to determine which data can be removed [1]. However, removing data can affect our perception of how things sound [2]. The point of contention is just how much data is truly inaudible [2]. The audio resolution and sonic quality of an MP3 is determined by the bitrate at which it is encoded [3]. Higher bitrates create better quality audio, but also larger file sizes [3]. Generally, 128 kbps is the bitrate at which MP3s begin to exhibit artifacts of data compression [4]. Another alternative is to encode using a variable bitrate (VBR), which examines the data as it encodes it and uses a lower rate for simple passages and a higher rate for more complex ones [5].","rejected":"Audio data compression uses 'lossy' methods, meaning that some of the data is altered and lost during compression.  [3][4]  Different types of audio compression include MP3, AAC, and ADPCM.

[1][2]  However, this means that very high frequencies are the first data to be eliminated, which can rob music of its subtle overtones, presence, dynamic range and depth of field. [1][5]  AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) is similar to MP3, but lower bitrates are used for more mundane audio, like podcasts, audiobooks, and musical instrument recordings.

People with colds and flus are not emergency conditions, but unfortunately many people don't have family doctors so they end up going to their local emergency room [1]. Another reason why people have to wait a long time is the time of day they go to the emergency room [2]. ERs are busier in the afternoon and early evening, so if you go at a peak time, it will take longer to be seen [2]. The seriousness of your condition also influences how long you wait [3].

{"chosen":"There are certain elements that dissolve in liquid water but are insoluble in ice, so as the solution freezes, they're forced out of the ice crystals and concentrate in the shrinking liquid phase. Additionally, if the final temperature is low enough, they precipitate together with the water remaining in the liquid solution, which usually remains in a regular freezer.  The resulting liquid has a stronger taste than the water did before being frozen, and this is most likely the cause for the difference in taste.  [1]  Furthermore, even after the ice melts to room temperature, the oxygen level in the melted ice water remains higher than the water that kept a constant room temperature, which could also be a reason for the different taste.

The reason for this is that when the experiment is conducted, the observer does not interfere with the behavior of the particles [2]. The observer merely observes the pattern of light emerging from the two slits, without absorbing any of the light [2]. In this way, the external observer is valuing knowledge that the researchers do not have, and thus changes the outcome of the experiment [2].","rejected":"This experiment is famous for its demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles [2].

Additionally, researchers have found that the brain guzzles between 44% and 87% of the total energy consumed by our resting bodies during infancy and childhood, thus causing children to be so hyper and full of energy [3].  Finally, this phenomenon is caused because children need this energy to grow and thus it's a reaction to their relationship with their individuality and the world around them [2].

{"chosen":"There are several theories as to how sunflowers are able to track the sun as it moves across the sky.  The first theory involves cell elongation, which is how most stems grow. If cell growth on the east and west sides are cyclical and matches the sun's movement, sunflower stems would appear to 'follow' the sun. [2]  Another theory involves water movement within the plant, known as turgor pressure. Water can be distributed differently within the stem and these differences in water pressure cause it to curve. This distribution of water pressures can be synchronised so that it would cause sunflowers to curve and mimic the sun's movements. [3]  Finally, researchers at UC Davis and UC Berkeley have linked their internal clock genes to stem growth, so that the eastern side of the stem elongates more than the western side during the day, turning the stem and flower westward to track the transiting sun. [4]","rejected":"Sunflowers move due to an internal rhythm of gene expression [1]. Two possible mechanisms that could explain this have been suggested: water movement within the plant, known as turgor pressure, and a circadian clock that's influenced by the direction of light [2, 3, 4]. While the support for the turgor pressure movement is that the water status of the soil can impact on whether sunflowers move or not, if it's dry they don't do it, and if the soil is waterlogged they don't do it either [3]. This suggests that water balance is important [3]. The circadian clock, which is linked to the direction of light, ensures that the plant reacts more strongly to light early in the morning than in the afternoon or evening, so it gradually stops moving westward during the day [4].","prompt":"the mechanism allowing or causing flowers to track the sun as it moves across the sky.\n\n[removed]"}

{"chosen":"The brainstem and its individual components, the medulla, pons and midbrain, are in control of breathing and the respiratory system's various parts [3]. The main section of the respiratory system responsible for breathing, or specifically inhalation, in the brain stem is the dorsal respiratory group [3]. Most animals need to breathe continuously, so the movements that provide or allow the flow of respiratory medium to the corresponding organ are generated by innate rhythmic programs that are carried out by specific neuronal structures and can operate independently of the higher brain centers [2]. These centers process signals from chemoreceptors that receive information regarding the concentration of respiratory gases in the internal fluid that carries them, and as a consequence of the evaluation of this information, they emit signals that regulate the concentration of these gases through a negative feedback system [2]. Tracheal ventilation of terrestrial insects appears to be regulated by signals sent by the metathoracic ganglia [2].","rejected":"Breathing happens when you inhale air into your nose or mouth and it travels down the back of your throat and into your windpipe, which is divided into air passages called bronchial tubes [2]. The bronchial tubes divide into smaller air passages called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in tiny balloon-like air sacs called alveoli [2]. There, oxygen from inhaled air passes into your blood [2]. Your blood then carries the carbon dioxide back to your lungs, where it\u2019s removed from your body when you exhale [2]. The part of the brain that controls breathing is called the respiratory center. Signals from this center travel down nerves to your diaphragm and other muscles [4]. The diaphragm is pulled flat, pushing out the lower ribcage and abdomen, which expands the chest and draws air into the lungs [4].","prompt":"How do we breathe?\n\nHow does our brain just know to breathe?

{"chosen":"When a wave crashes onto the shore, it pushes water towards the shore, raising the water level [1]. This water will try to flow back offshore via the lowest point along the beach, creating a rip current [1, 2]. A rip current is a narrow, swift current that flows out to sea [1]. It occurs when sandbars change the underwater profile of a beach area, causing waves that come onshore to be channeled out a gap in the sandbars [2]. When waves crash onshore, the water has to return to sea, and the force of the water moving through a tight space causes it to move rapidly and with great force [2, 3, 4]. This can result in a gentle current that runs back out to sea [4], or a strong current that builds up and seeks a weak point in the breaking waves [4].

In addition, animals do not have the same capacity for language as humans, as demonstrated by studies showing that animal communication is instinctive and predictable, whereas human language is creative and unpredictable [2, 3]. For example, when scientists taught chimpanzees to use sign language, the chimps were unable to combine words in different orders to create new meanings, which is a basic skill of human language [2]. Some scientists also believe that animal communication is limited by duality of pattern, a key feature of human language [3].

Some stocks pay regular dividends, which is a given amount of money per share of stock that someone owns. The other way investors can profit from buying stocks is by selling their stock for a profit if the stock price increases from their purchase price [4]. For example, if an investor buys shares of a company\u2019s stock at $10 a share and the stock price later increases to $20, the investor can make a $10 profit per share by selling their stock [4].

{"chosen":"One of the main reasons that people are reluctant to consider quantum gravity is because of human nature. Many people in the general relativity (GR) community dislike the idea of disruptive change and prefer to stay with what they are familiar with [1]. Moreover, the quantum mechanical universe doesn't pay any attention to what our macroscopic (SR) experience tells us about how things work. For example, when a nucleus experiences a double neutron decay, two electrons and two neutrinos are emitted [2]. If neutrinos are Majorana particles, neutrinoless double beta decay should be possible [2]. Experiments are actively looking for evidence of this [2]. The universe at a fundamental level is not just made of quantized packets of matter and energy, but the fields that permeate the universe are inherently quantum as well [2]. According to physicists, we must include gravity among the quantum fields because it curves the space-time backdrop and then quantum interactions occur in that curved space [2]. Without a quantized gravitational field, it is certain that we are overlooking quantum gravitational effects that ought to exist [2].","rejected":"Quantum mechanics needs to be fine-tuned to remove the null results and to take into consideration quantum gravity, which is the study of gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics [1, 2]. Quantum mechanics is currently understood to describe the other three fundamental forces of physics - electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force - but there is still no satisfactory theory of quantum gravity to describe the force of gravity [2]. This is because approaches to quantizing gravity have so far failed or reached a stalemate [1]. One of the main reasons for this is the extreme difficulty of marrying a classical system, which is governed by general relativity, with a quantum one, which requires loop quantum gravity or M-theory [2]. To describe quantum effects closer to the center of a black hole, where the effects of gravity are strong, a theory of quantum gravity is needed [2]. Quantum gravity theories aim to describe the quantum behavior of the gravitational field [2]. They do not necessarily attempt to unify all fundamental interactions [2].","prompt":"Why does QM *need* gravity to be quantized? Why can't it be left not a fundamental force, but a space-time curvature as per GR?\n\nAlso, could it be, that a black hole is so small, that if we're speaking of what's inside we're already below Planck's scale? At which point renormalization* breaks down, and since GR gives correct results for black holes and QM does not, it should be QM that's gotta give, not the other way around?\n\n* I've been lead to believe 'renormalization' means 'let's calculate things up to some scale because beyond that our maths break down'. That seems to support the intuition QM is 'wrong' at that scales, and is itself something that needs to be adjusted to GR, not the other way around.

{"chosen":"Turbulence is caused by wind [1]. It can arise close to the ground when wind blows hard against an airplane, causing it to shake [1]. At higher altitudes, turbulence arises when air rises vertically, from low to high [2]. This usually happens when the sun warms the earth and the air above it, causing hot air to expand and rise [2]. If the air continues to rise, particles of moisture begin to form in it, creating clouds [2]. Thermal turbulence is caused by the sun heating the earth's surface unevenly, so that convective currents are set in motion with warm air rising and cool air descending [3]. This type of turbulence can occur in cumulonimbus or rain bearing clouds, and may be quite intense [3]. In response to this threat, the FAA has developed guidance material to help air carriers and operators prevent turbulence injuries and minimize the risks when airplanes do encounter it [4].","rejected":"Turbulence can be caused by four main factors: mechanical turbulence, instability of the air, rough terrain, and strong wind speed [1].

Capillary action occurs in narrow spaces when hard boundaries are very close to each other [1,2]. In these cases, the liquid can flow upward against gravity [1]. This is fundamental for trees to bring the nutrients up to the leaves. Capillarity is generated by cohesive and adhesive forces. The water is moved up in straw because of the interaction of the adhesive forces between the fluid and the solid surfaces with the surface tension of the liquid [1]. The water is \"pulled\" along the wall of the straw by the adhesive force while the cohesive forces in order to maintain the original surface tension, pull the rest of the liquid in the motion direction [1].

Secondly, AJAX's core function is to update web content asynchronously, meaning a user's web browser doesn't need to reload an entire web page when only a small portion of content on the page needs to change [2]. One of the most prevalent examples of this is Google's \"Google Suggest\" feature, which automatically begins offering auto-complete options while you type without needing to manually refresh the page [2].

This is not necessarily true, as indicated by the fact that cookies do not have an expiration date, but rather a best by date. [3] What actually happens is that the sugar in the cookie acts as a super concentrated solution, and it pulls fluid from the milk, as well as any bacteria that might cause spoilage. This kills the bacteria through osmosis. [2]\n\nAnother factor to consider is the type of milk used. While regular cow's milk is generally fine for cooking, soy milk may be used instead, which is sweeter. This can lead to a perception that cookies made with milk are more prone to spoiling. However, milk does not spoil due to bacteria, but rather due to the lactose in the milk being converted into glucose and galactose by bacteria, which forms lactic acid that causes the milk to curdle.

[2]  For example, poplars tend to live shorter lives than willow trees, but they can grow to a greater height and have a wider spread.  [3]  Diehard trees in a dense forest do die, but they are honored as legends for their age and stature.  [1][2]  Small trees in gardens are not longlived trees and often can  be rejuvenated by good care. [2]  Also, hybrid poplars may have a longer life than willow trees in some cases.

{"chosen":"To determine the nutritional value of food, there are several approaches which can be taken. The first is the analytical route, which involves using chemical analysis to determine the energy content as well as the quantities of other energy-containing ingredients, such as fats, proteins, and carbohydrates [2]. The second method is the literature route, in which no analysis of the final product is done, but rather databases containing data on nutritional values of processed and unprocessed foods are used [3]. The USDA has a very extensive database for this purpose [3]. In the Netherlands, a database exists as well, from the RIVM [3]. When literature data is not available, another approach is to calculate the energy content of the food using a simple calculation [1]. This calculation involves determining how much of each component is in the food, then multiplying this value with the energy content for each specific component, and finally adding up all of these numbers to obtain the energy content of the food [1].","rejected":"The amount of energy (i.e., Calories) in food is determined by looking at the nutritional value [1].

However, the Atwater system is too general and cannot possibly give an accurate count for every individual sample [3]. Critics argue that the Atwater system is too general and cannot possibly give an accurate count for every individual sample [3]. In addition, the amount of absorption and digestion varies from one person to another [3].

The wheel bevels are specifically designed so that when the train goes around a corner it stays on the tracks [1]. The wheels that have to travel a greater distance have a greater diameter, and everything stays aligned [1]. The conical wheel is superior to other designs because it allows the train to stay on the track when going around a corner [2].

{"chosen":"Poor eyesight is a result of a variety of possible explanations, some of which have existed since early in human history [2]. Visual acuity hasn't been terribly important to human populations for some time, meaning that having poor eyesight did not have an appreciable impact on people's ability to survive and reproduce [2]. Another possible explanation is that visual acuity is indeed important for humans, but our technologies have been relaxing the selection pressures that were keeping it sharp [4]. The invention and\/or proliferation of corrective lenses served to remove any reproductive disadvantage associated with poor vision [4]. Development insults, like infectious organisms, can also cause eyesight to fail to develop properly in some people [3].","rejected":"There are a few possible explanations for why so many people need glasses. One is that visual acuity is important and people's eyes sometimes fail to develop properly because of developmental insults like infectious organisms [1]. Another is that the numbers of younger children and adults who need glasses appear to be rising over time [2]. With age, the smooth surface of the eye can be damaged by conditions like blepharitis, an inflammation of the eyelids, leading to blurry vision [3]. The lens in our eyes is also subject to the aging process, and conditions like cataracts and presbyopia will eventually affect just about everyone [4]. When we are born, our lenses are completely clear, meaning the image entering the eye is not degraded by any opacity, and they are also very pliable, meaning the lens can change its shape to help focus images that are very far away as well as very close [4]. However, as we grow older, our lenses cloud up and become less pliable [4]. The clouding of the lens, or cataract, forces an image to travel through a distorted medium, resulting in diminished vision [4]. A hardened lens becomes more fixed on distant objects and cannot focus as well on nearby objects or vice versa [4].","prompt":"If our primary sense is sight then how are there so many people with poor eyes?\n\nI feel like someone with poor eyesight would not stand a chance thousands of years ago."}

{"chosen":"There are a number of reasons why men appear to lose weight and get in shape easier than women. They include the fact that men tend to have more muscle mass, which burns more calories than body fat, even at rest [1, 3]. When men and women cut the same number of calories, men usually do lose more weight [1]. Another reason is that women have a higher level of estrogen, which works to keep fat on a woman's body so it's easier for her to get pregnant [2]. Still another reason is that men's bodies respond more quickly to exercise, while women's bodies go into starvation mode, slowing the metabolism to hang onto more fat [4]. Also, the average woman has a smaller lung capacity than the average man, which can make her feel as though she is working harder than men even if they are doing the same activity [4].","rejected":"There are some physiological and hormonal differences between men and women that affect weight loss [1].

Men tend to lose weight where they need it most (belly), so it's often more immediately noticeable when overweight men start trimming down than when women do [2]. Even basic, regular exercise tends to reduce abdominal obesity, even if guys don't technically lose weight [2]. Finally, research has suggested that the differences in metabolic outcomes observed in men and women who follow the same diet could be because men may mobilize more fat from their abdomens during weight loss, while women may lose more subcutaneous fat [4].","prompt":"what is it so much easier more males to lose weight\/get in shape than females?"}

{"chosen":"There are many reasons why we can't be sure that players didn't use steroids in the past. First of all, records are difficult or impossible to verify, since there's no way to test players retroactively for steroids [1, 3, 4]. Second, there is no hope of reliable evidence about who used and who didn't use PEDs in the past, since baseball didn't institute league-wide PED testing until 2003 [1, 3]. With the BALCO controversy, which brought into question players such as Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi, and Gary Sheffield, all of them denied using steroids, but prosecutors claimed that substances they admitted to using were \"the cream\" and \"the clear,\" steroids designed to be undetectable by conventional tests [3, 4]. Since baseball instituted suspensions for first-time steroid use, there have been multiple suspensions of Major League and Minor League players [4]. steroid use cast a shadow of doubt over records and milestones today that would never have engendered this type of discussion decades ago [4].","rejected":"While historians cannot say for sure whether or not players were using steroids or other performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) in the past, there is some evidence that suggests they were. Testosterone was first synthesized in Germany in 1935, and was used medically to treat depression [1]. Professional athletes began misusing anabolic steroids during the 1954 Olympics, when Russian weightlifters were given testosterone [1]. In the 1980s, anabolic steroid use began to extend into the general population, and young men began using these substances, sometimes to enhance athletic performance but in most cases to improve personal appearance [1]. Amphetamines are a class of performance-enhancing drugs which have been used by baseball players for many years. A stimulant, they were referred to as \"greenies\" in the 1970s and users included Willie Stargell, Dave Parker, Jim Bouton and Bill Madlock [3]. While steroids had been part of baseball's banned substance list since 1991, testing for major league players did not begin until 2003, when MLB conducted surveys to help gauge the extent of performance-enhancing drug (PED) use in the game [4]. The agreement with the league players' union (MLBPA) called for one random test per player per year","prompt":"If steroids were around since the 1930's how do we know older players didn't use them?\n\nWith records being tarnished from the \"steroid era\" in baseball, that seems to imply that we're sure older players didn't use them.

{"chosen":"The connection between the vestibular, or inner ear system, and the visual system is extremely important because it coordinates movement with balance and provides an awareness of your spatial orientation [1]. The visual system interacts with the vestibular system by allowing images to be seen clearly and to maintain image stability when there is head movement [1]. For example, when you move, the vestibular system sends a message to your brain [1]. The brain uses this information to help you maintain spatial awareness and know your direction of movement [1]. If you make large, fast or prolonged movements such as spinning around in circles, it can take some time for your vestibular system to catch-up to your visual system and then \u201csettle-down\u201d after you\u2019ve stopped moving [1].

[2, 3] Since the movement stops once you stop spinning, the hairs stay bent and send signals to the brain that you are still moving.

{"chosen":"There are multiple reasons why your eyes water when you choke. One is that there are nerves in your throat that are sensitive to anything touching your epiglottis inwards and down into your airway, and these nerves trigger a choking reflex that causes a cough and various secretions to happen [1]. At the same time, the same secretory-motor system also makes your eyes water a bit, which is why your nose can run when you cry [1, 2]. The tears that you have in your eyes drain down a little plug hole in your lower eyelid towards the middle, but when you choke, food or drink will enter the air tube and the respiratory tract is obstructed [3]. The tear passage and respiratory tract share a same part, the nasal tube, and when the respiratory tract is obstructed, the tear passage is obstructed too [3]. As a result, both tears and air can not get through the nasal smoothly, and you cough to get the obstruction out and to breath [3]. The tears then just flow the other way out through your eyes [3].","rejected":"The choking reflex is designed to protect your airway by sending nerve signals to your body that trigger coughing and the expulsion of air from your lungs [1, 2, 3]. When something touches the roof of your mouth, the back of your tongue, or the area around your tonsils, your body triggers a gag reflex [2]. The gag reflex causes your throat to contract and protect your airway by moving anything that is threatening to your airway out of the way [1, 2, 3]. At the same time, the gag reflex causes your eyes to water a bit because the same secretory-motor system that moves your throat muscles also makes tears come to your eyes and blow air up your tear duct [1, 3]. Normally, the tears drain down little punctum, a plug hole in your lower eyelid, and go down towards the naso-lacrymal duct and drip into your nose [1]. If you are coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose, the pressure is reversed, and the tears come back up your tear duct and into your eye [1].","prompt":"why do your eyes water when you choke?"}
{"chosen":"A study revealed that the gene responsible for dry earwax originated in an ancient northeastern Asian population [1]. Today, 80 to 95 percent of East Asians have dry earwax, whereas the wet variety is abundant in people of African and European ancestry [1]. A mutation in a gene controls the flow of molecules that directly affect earwax type [2]. This gene is believed to have originated to prevent less odor and sweating, which may play a role as a pheromone [3]. Earwax may also be dry because it clumps together more easily [4].","rejected":"The color, texture, and amount of earwax vary naturally from person to person [1]. In general, the color has a bit to do with the age of the earwax [1]. Newer earwax tends to be lighter in color, and it darkens as it ages and picks up more debris [1]. However, some people produce more wax than is common, or the ears may produce more wax when a person is very stressed [1]. When this happens, the ears may not be able to get rid of the wax fast enough [1]. Researchers believe that the mutation reached high frequencies in Northeast Eurasia and, following a population increase, expanded over the rest of the continent [3].

{"chosen":"One of the main reasons that medical marijuana is still not widely legal is the fact that it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance, meaning that it has no medical use and is considered dangerous [4]. This makes it very difficult to pass policy regarding its use in medical situations, as states that allow medical marijuana are defying federal law [4]. Another factor that makes it difficult to legalize medical marijuana is the lack of clear evidence on how long-term marijuana usage affects the body [5]. Without this data, legislators are hesitant to approve it for medical use and risk outweighing the reward [5]. The process of legalizing medical marijuana is also made more difficult by the extra hurdles and complexities associated with implementing marijuana policy [5]. States that have legalized recreational marijuana use have experienced consequences such as increased marijuana-related traffic accidents and youth consumption, which are somewhat anecdotal and hard to draw conclusions from given the limited timeframe of implementation [5]. These factors, in addition to the fact that with many counties and cities leaning toward opting out of a statewide adult-use marijuana program, some legislators have an incentive to not support a bill [5].","rejected":"There are a number of reasons why legalizing medical and recreational cannabis is proving to be difficult. The first reason is that support for cannabis legalization depends heavily on party preference [2]. While the majority of Democrats and Independents favor legalization, only 53% of Republicans do [2]. Since Republicans control the Senate and the Oval Office, there is no pressing need to push for reform, even though the American public is firmly in favor of cannabis reform [2]. \n\nThe second reason is that the U.S. federal government has been largely unwavering on its view of marijuana, holding firm on its Schedule I classification [1]. In plain English, this means it's illegal, prone to abuse, and has no recognized medical benefits [1]. As long as this federal classification exists, there remains a pretty firm ceiling on marijuana's potential within the United States [1].\n\nA third reason is that legalization would create a money problem for the federal government [3]. As a Schedule I drug, businesses that deal in cannabis are disallowed from taking normal corporate income tax deductions, per Section 280E of the tax code [3]. With only cost of goods sold able to be deducted from revenue, most profitable weed companies pay a very high effective tax rate [3].

If an owner is looking for 300k for 5% of a company at a 6mil valuation but the investor says the valuation is too high (he thinks 3mil) and he offers 300k for 10%, it means that the owner is looking to sell his company for 300k and the investor is offering to buy it for 300k plus 10% of the company [1][2]. In this case, the valuation of the company will likely affect the deal because the owner will either take the higher offer of 300k or negotiate the lower 10% deal down to 5% [1]. The actual numbers involved will depend on the investor's offer and the owner's counteroffer. The reason this deal is possible is that the Sharks on the show will often counteroffer lower valuations to increase their profit margin [2]. However, the lower valuation will likely impact the company's success, as an investor will sometimes turn down a deal if it is not profitable enough [1].

When you write programming code, you use keywords that are familiar to us as humans (While, If, Else, Or, Do, and a number of others) and when ready, it is converted to the language the computer speaks [2].

These programming languages use rules defined by the language to format how code should be written [2]. There are thousands of different programming languages, and each has its own program that translates the language to binary code [2, 3]. However, it is very tedious to write code in binary, so higher level languages were created to make it easier to create programs [3]. The programmer writes instructions in the selected language and these instructions or source code are stored in text form in a file [4]. The source file is then passed to a program called a compiler which translates the source language to object code in binary form and writes that to another file called the program [4].","prompt":"Hey Li5, how does coding\/programming work?\n\nThank you ;)"}

For example, animal habitats are not usually teeming with water bodies, and many animals come from far-flung regions to seek out a source of water [3]. They have to drink water from that very lake, and their lives depend on it [3].

This blood travels through arteries into the capillaries (which lie in all of the tissues of the body), where the oxygen and nutrients are transferred to the tissues and are replaced with waste products, including carbon dioxide, water and urea [1]. The venous blood at the ankle just after going through the capillaries has just enough pressure left in it to push it back to the heart [1]. However, when we stand up, the pumping action of the heart on the arterial blood flowing to the legs is enhanced by gravity, so the blood has a difficult time getting back to the heart [2].

The first stop is in your kidneys and liver to dump waste before returning the blood back to the heart [2]. The second stop is in the dural sinuses within the dura mater surrounding the brain, which receive blood from the brain [3]. From these sinuses, blood eventually enters the internal jugular vein [3].

The system of national cemeteries was established in 1862 to ensure the proper burial of all service members. Still, many unknown remains were recovered in the years following the Civil War. At Arlington National Cemetery, there are individual Civil War unknown burials as well as the remains of 2,111 Union and Confederate soldiers buried beneath the Tomb. [1] During the Spanish-American War, the US military's policy was to repatriate the bodies of service members who died abroad. New Army regulations required that soldiers be buried in temporary graves with identifying information. Army's Quartermaster Corps, which oversaw burials and repatriation of bodies, employed a burial corps.

Normally, a snake breathes through its nostrils, but it can also breathe through its mouth by using its glottis, which is the opening in the bottom of the mouth that is kept closed except when inhaling [2]. When a snake fills its mouth with food, the tracheal lung helps it to breathe by extending the pathway leading to the lungs [1]. This happens by shifting the glottis, which is connected to the trachea, to the side of the mouth, which allows the snake to still breathe while it is eating [1, 2]. It is also possible that a snake has a single lung, as some sources mention that the snake uses an epiglottis, a muscular extension of its windpipe, to reach air and allow it to breathe while swallowing food [3].","rejected":"Snakes do have a nose, but they do not breathe through it.

Deadly arrhythmias include ventricular fibrillation, a condition in which the lower chambers of the heart quiver rather than pump blood (and oxygen) effectively, and ventricular tachycardia, a fast, abnormal heart rate [1]. A heart attack can also cause death during sleep. During a heart attack, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen.

How intrusive buffeting can get depends on the car\u2019s shape and the size of its windows as well as the speed the vehicle is traveling. Modern cars and trucks are more subject to air thump because they\u2019re so aerodynamically efficient and well sealed against wind intrusion.

The smaller the opening, the higher the pitch. [3]  The throbbing noise is worse from the rear windows because the air flows more aerodynamically over the rear windows.  The airflow over the front windows is less aerodynamic due to the side mirrors which disturb the air flow.

This action causes the sound waves we hear as the \"helicopter\" sound [1]. The same principle is used when opening a bottle; the smaller the opening, the higher the pitch of the sound [3].

It is possible that some \"sub-theory\" of quantum mechanics, like quantum electrodynamics, could turn out to be fluid, but if the laws of quantum mechanics itself are in flux, that would be very bizarre [1]. Still, some philosophers of science have concluded that one cannot give a good definition of \"laws of nature\" except as our best summary so far of the regularities which have been perceived [3]. In other words, the whole of science is based on induction, which amounts to saying it is based on the reasonable conjecture that the universe will carry on being like it has been in the past, just changing over very long timescales [3]. Nothing is absolutely guaranteed, and so it is better to accept the uncertainty and go out for that walk, and also carry on with all our other efforts to do something creative [3].","rejected":"There are many reasons to believe that the laws of physics are not absolute. First, we have no way of proving that there are absolute physical laws, because any theory that we come up with can be discounted if there exists a process that violates it that we haven't yet observed [2]. Second, as new evidence is uncovered, the understanding of physical laws can change [4]. For example, when scientists discovered quantum mechanics, they realized that classical mechanics couldn't explain interactions at the subatomic level, so they scrapped the old law and came up with a new one [4]. Finally, even if there were absolute physical laws, there is no guarantee that they wouldn't change over time either, either because of a process we haven't observed or because we reach a point where we have no way of distinguishing between competing models [1, 2]. For example, there is some speculation that early cosmic inflation would explain why the universe appears to be uniform, but so far there is no concrete evidence of it [2].

{"chosen":"In terms of microeconomics, how does piracy of digital goods affect supply, demand, sale, price, etc.? [1] Sales of digital goods via traditional channels are affected by those on digital channels, and thus a competitive relationship often exists. In addition, due to the ease of piracy, digital goods may suffer from a fall in demand, which intensifies competition. This study considers a single supplier who sells digital goods, which may be pirated, to customers through two independent and different retail channels, such as traditional and digital ones, which may compete with each other in terms of service and price. To consider the effects of piracy on demand, a Stackelberg game is utilized to determine the optimal gain-sharing ratio and the equilibrium prices for all channel members with an aim to maximize the profit of the entire supply chain. It is found that an increase in piracy would force retailers to compete in a smaller market. [1]  The piracy phenomenon of newly developed digital goods such as mobile applications has attracted debates on the impact of piracy on legitimate sales. While the application developers claim that piracy harms their profits, proponents of piracy argue that they have justified reasons for the activities as piracy of mobile applications does not necessarily harm developers\u2019 profits.

[1, 2] The strain gauges in the load cell are arranged like the resistors in a Wheatstone bridge. When a load is placed on the gauges, they compress, and the level of compression corresponds to the amount of force exerted on the strain gauge. Compression also changes the resistance of the gauge, just like in a Wheatstone bridge. As a result, there is a voltage output corresponding to the change from the stressed gauges.

{"chosen":"There are many reasons why cell phone coverage is not 100% perfect. One key reason is that cell phone signal must push through walls, interior building material, and other interference once a person goes inside a building [1]. Another reason coverage gaps arise is that there is minimal or no overlap between cell sites. Ideally, hexagonal cell sites in a grid would cover 100% of the city, but cell sites are circular in range, so small gaps occur when cell sites are next to each other [5]. To maintain efficiency, cells ideally provide reception up to the edge of the next cell site, but signal strength fades the farther a user strays from the tower. If a user strays too far from the fringe of two adjacent sites, coverage can get dropped [5]. Additionally, cell phone signal operates with a certain frequency, so the closer a person is to -50 dBm, the better the signal and the closer to -120 dBm, the worse the signal [2]. Other possible reasons for bad reception include the use of low-power transmitters by cell phones and base stations, which transmit at low power to keep within the cell range [5].","rejected":"There are several factors that may affect wireless network connectivity, including proximity to a cell site, physical obstacles, and signal interference.

[1, 2] Physical obstructions such as buildings and trees are the typical culprits, as they can act like terrain. Physical objects can also create a multipath environment, in which transmissions that bounce off objects at an acute angle cause signal reflections (i.e. echos) called multipath signals. Having travelled a further distance than a straight line transmission, these signals are delayed (longer propagation delay), and to a simple receiver would be nothing more than interference. [2, 3]There are cases where the signal is still weak outside even though the distance to the cell tower isn't too far away and there aren't any major terrain obstructions. In these cases, the culprit is typically the angling of the broadcasting antenna. Most rural cell towers use three directional broadcasting antennas, each focusing signal to cover a 120 degree sector.

Another theory is that pain itself can cause our bodies to become more sensitive.

In contrast, the cells of a multicellular organism function differently from the cells of an unicellular organism, but in every organism, each cell has specialized cell structures, or organelles, that carry out a variety of functions, such as obtaining nutrients, producing energy, and making proteins [1, 2]. Some organisms are simple and only contain an information molecule describing how to obtain energy and reproduce the molecule [1]. Other more complex multi-cellular organisms go through complex mating rituals to introduce two haploid cells together which will fuse and become a new organism [1]. Whether a collection of organisms becomes a single organism largely depends on the environment in which the organisms exist [4].

This creates a continual cycle of upward moving air around the flame (a convection current), which gives the flame its elongated or teardrop shape.

Additionally, people who work shifts may have trouble adjusting to a normal sleep\/wake cycle since humans are built to sleep at night and roam during the day [4]. Bipolar disorders can also cause people to sleep longer since they may veer from 18 hours of sleep one night to four hours the next [2].

For example, during REM sleep, the brain is more active, and the EEG activity recorded from the scalp resembles that seen during wakefulness [1, 3]. Atonia, or a complete loss of muscle tone, prevents us from acting our dreams and injuring ourselves during sleep [1].

{"chosen":"A hyperloop is a proposed high-speed mass transportation system for both freight and passenger transport [1]. The concept is based on overcoming the two main barriers to faster transportation: friction and air resistance [4].

This means that very little energy is required for running these trains at high speeds [4]. The hyperloop could potentially move people or objects at airline speeds while being energy efficient compared with existing high-speed rail systems [1]. The most obvious advantage is the speed, with some designs claiming a peak speed of 1220 kph (760 mph) [5]. The hyperloop could reduce travel times compared to train and airplane travel over distances of under 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) [1].

{"chosen":"A wind turbine turns wind energy into electricity using the aerodynamic force from the rotor blades, which work like an airplane wing or helicopter rotor blade [2]. When wind flows across the blade, the air pressure on one side of the blade decreases, creating lift and drag [2]. The force of the lift is stronger than the drag, which causes the rotor to spin [2]. The rotor connects to the generator, either directly (if it\u2019s a direct drive turbine) or through a shaft and a series of gears (a gearbox) that speed up the rotation and allow for a physically smaller generator [2]. This translation of aerodynamic force to rotation of a generator creates electricity [2]. Electricity from the wind turbine generator travels to a transmission substation where it is converted into extremely high voltage, between 155,000 and 765,000 volts, for long distance transmission on the transmission grid [3]. This grid comprises a series of power lines that connect the power sources to demand centers [3].","rejected":"A wind turbine uses the kinetic energy from the wind to make energy [4].

{"chosen":" Humans are intellectually superior to primates, including chimpanzees, for several reasons. Chimpanzees can learn new tricks by imitating humans or other apes, but only humans routinely teach each other [1]. One reason for this is that humans have extended synaptic development, which allows us to absorb information and experiences from the environment during infancy and childhood [2]. This process, called synaptogenesis, involves the formation of synaptic connections, strengthening useful connections, and eliminating useless connections [3]. In humans, peak expression of synaptic genes in the prefrontal cortex doesn't occur until about age five, but in chimps and macaques, this occurs in the first year of life [3]. Another reason is that brains demand a large amount of energy, and larger brains have more neurons, so great apes can't afford to feed more neurons than they already have [4].

When the Russian Federation Border Troops were formed, the Intelligence Directorate was formed within them. Later an edict of the Russian president created the Federal Border Service -- the High Command of the Border Troops, where the Intelligence Directorate is located. It is entrusted with conducting intelligence, counterintelligence, and operational-investigative activity in the interests of ensuring that the state border is guarded.

When great powers were concerned with possible invasion, they would seek to gain territory on their frontier to delay the possible advance of a rival army and allow for a strategy of defense-in-depth [1]. The increased amount of time it would take for an invading military to march across the buffer state would make invasion less likely to succeed, due to the increased defensive capability of the state being invaded [1]. Buffer states were required to ensure the security of great powers with permeable geographical frontiers [1]. Given the ease with which a prospective invader could advance on Russia\u2019s western frontier, buffer states to increase the time Russia would have to deploy defensive forces were seen as a positive [1]. Once nuclear weapons were invented, however, buffer states were no longer seen as necessary regardless of geography, as nuclear deterrence worked to ensure the territorial integrity of great powers with nuclear capabilities [1]. The need for buffer states across the world has declined since 1945, as nuclear weapons programs have made the threat of retaliation so high that buffer states are no longer required, and defense alliances replace the need for buffer states [2].","prompt":"How does Russia keep its massive border secure?"}

This notion means that journalists tend to include and play up those elements of a story that make it more newsworthy, and the stories that are most likely to be reported are those with dramatic aspects [1]. In relation to crime specifically, Jewkes (2004) suggest these news events have to be considered significant or dramatic enough to be in the news \u2013 a single rape may make the local newspaper [1].

Tone refers to the way a guitar sounds, and there are a wide variety of factors that affect the tone of a guitar, including the type of wood, the shape, the size, the pickups, and if the body is solid or hollow [2]. As all of the above technical issues are unable to be resolved mid-song, a guitarist will simply switch to a backup guitar [3]. The backup guitar will often be a similar model to the one experiencing a technical issue [3]. It\u2019s common for guitar manufacturers to loan a new range of guitars to a well-known guitarist for the duration of a tour. The guitarist may also be required to take part in interviews regarding the new product range, which the manufacturer can use within their marketing material [4].

After at least 10 minutes, remove the item and scrub off any leftover rust with a soft-bristled brush [3, 4]. The acidity of the vinegar will eat away at the rust, making it easier to remove [4]. Another option is to mix together lemon juice and salt to form a paste, then spread the paste on the rusty metal and allow it to set for a while before scrubbing it off [3].","rejected":"There are a number of ways to remove rust. The method that is considered the best for removing rust is electrolytic rust removal, also known as magic [1]. This method involves setting up a conductive solution and inserting some sacrificial anodes. You then hang your rusted tool in the solution and attach it to the negative end of the power supply. You then attach the positive end to the anode and turn on the power. The current travels through the solution and in the process flakes off the rust, because of the reaction at the surface of the good steel that pushes the rust off [1].\n\nAnother easy method for removing rust is to use white vinegar. In this method, you add some vinegar to a bowl of water, submerge your rusty instruments in a bowl of vinegar, and let the instruments sit overnight so they can soak the vinegar mixed water. After soaking the water, remove the instruments from the bowl. Then take steel wool or a wire brush and scrub the instruments to rust off [2].\n\nYou can also use baking soda to remove rust.

[2]  Sebaceous glands are, in turn, regulated by your brain\u2019s pituitary gland. Your pituitary gland is in charge of your body\u2019s entire endocrine (hormonal) system. [3]  Very active androgens, like testosterone, are produced by your adrenal glands and your ovaries or testes.  These glands are, in turn, regulated by your brain\u2019s pituitary gland. [4]  Researchers do know that its primary function is to protect your skin and hair from moisture loss.  Oil may have an antimicrobial or antioxidant role. Research into these potential functions is ongoing. [4]","rejected":"Sebum is an oily substance produced by our skin glands that flows through our pores and protects and moisturizes our skin [1, 5]. Sebum is essential for pliable skin and helps to eliminate excess lipids and cholesterol, which can block arteries and cause heart disease [3]. It also seems to support heart health by eliminating excess lipids and cholesterol [3]. Our facial skin produces more sebum than other body parts because that is where the sebaceous glands are concentrated [1, 2]. The levels of lipids secreted have to be properly balanced to prevent skin irritation so the face, scalp, upper neck, and chest are prone to acne breakouts or oily skin [2]. Babies are born with sebaceous glands over most of their bodies, with the exception of the palms of the hands, tops and soles of the feet, and lower lips [1]. These glands produce significant amounts of sebum right after birth as the hormones influence them regulate the glands and they start to decrease by age 20 [1].","prompt":"What is the advantage of our facial skin producing more oil than the rest of our body parts?"}

The warm moist atmosphere of summer is therefore thicker and less transparent than the crisp, cold winter dome, making it easier to see stars and other objects on a cold winter night [1]. Astronomers believe that the Milky Way contains about 300 billion stars, and that the stars we see on a cold winter night are a greater proportion of those stars [2]. The seven winter constellations and five circumpolar constellations that are visible all year round are also brighter than the rest of the stars because they are north of the celestial pole and therefore appear to be orbiting the north star [4].","rejected":"The reason that there are more stars in the winter months than in the summer months is because the universe we face at different times of the year is different.

{"chosen":"There are a number of reasons why a tablet may feel like it is stuck in your throat after swallowing, most of which have to do with the physiology of the throat and esophagus and our inability to sufficiently moisten the area prior to swallowing [1,2,3,4]. Regarding the former, our throat is large enough to accommodate most tablets, but occasionally a pill may become lodged in the throat behind the voice box, which can be uncomfortable [1]. This may also occur if the pill has a coating that makes it more difficult to swallow [4].

{"chosen":"There are many different causes that lead to powders clumping together in a water solution. One of the most common causes is the presence of liquid bridges [1]. When a liquid is present on the surface of the powder, it fills some porosity but above a certain threshold it can start creating bridges in between the particles [1]. The bridges then hold the particles together and create a lump [1]. Another cause is glass transition; amorphous materials tend to cake when the humidity is high [2]. The molecules in the powder attract and hold onto moisture, which is why the clumping occurs [3]. High-speed blenders and shaker bottles can be used to mix the powder into a smooth solution [4]. Adding half of the liquid and the powder to a shaker bottle and shaking until the powder is smooth is one method that can be used [4]. Another method is to add about a quarter of the liquid to a cup, add the powder, and stir vigorously until the clumps are gone, then add the rest of the liquid and stir [4].

{"chosen":"The primary difference between the Base-6 and Base-10 number systems is that in Base-6, digits range from 0-5, whereas in Base-10, digits range from 0-9 [1]. In the Base-6 system, the number 6 would be expressed as 10 in base six [1]. Additionally, in the hexadecimal (Base-16) numeral system, the symbols \"0\" through \"9\" are used to represent values 0-9, and \"A\" through \"F\" are used to represent values 10-15 [2]. This is different from the Base-10 system, which uses the numbers 0-9 in each digit. Another difference is that hexadecimal numerals are concise, as they use only 16 distinct symbols (versus the Base-10 system's use of 10 symbols) [2]. This allows hexadecimal to be used to write large binary numbers in just a few digits [5]. Finally, the advantage of using hexadecimal is that it makes life easier as it allows grouping of binary numbers, which makes it easier to read, write, and understand [4,5].","rejected":"The main difference between the Base-10 number system that we use and number systems that are based on other numbers is that Base-10 \"ticks over\" when it gets 10 items, creating a new digit [1].

Another difference is that in the Base-10 system, we have 10 digits, consisting of 0 through 9, and we need a sufficient number of digits to \"fill up\" until we hit the next number [3]. In contrast, other number systems may have different numbers of digits, such as two digits [2] or eight digits [5].

In contrast, machines can surpass humans at anything that is bounded and literal [1]. As a result, while machines can beat humans at chess, humans can still have a place in the chess world by using their creative and values-based skills to make strategic decisions about what roles and tasks should be assigned to machines and what roles and decisions should be protected for humans [2]. An additional reason for the continued popularity of chess is that, unlike video games, it doesn't require the latest gaming equipment or graphics card and is thus accessible to a wide range of people [3].

If Earth were much less massive, like Mars, gravity's grip would be weaker [1]. Thus, gravity is the reason we have air pressure in the first place [2]. It pulls on the atmosphere, compressing it, and creating pressure [2]. Air pressure is not uniform throughout the atmosphere. The lower the altitude, the higher the air pressure; thus, as you move higher, the air pressure decreases [2].

Another reason is that the cable industry is quietly securing a growing monopoly over American broadband [3]. The nation's top cable companies added a whopping 83% of all net broadband subscribers last quarter [3]. All told, the nation's top cable companies (predominately Charter Spectrum and Comcast) added 2.7 million broadband subscribers in 2017 [3].

Many patients find that they cannot sleep because of the physical changes caused by the cancer or surgery, changes in their daily lives due to the treatment for the cancer, stress about having cancer, and health problems that are not related to the cancer [1, 2]. Common cancer treatments and drugs affect the quality of sleep [3]. Stopping or decreasing the use of certain drugs can cause insomnia, and changing the dose or frequency of use of others can also affect normal sleep patterns [3].

Research shows that the body repairs and rejuvenates itself while you sleep [2]. For example, while we are awake, neurons in the brain produce adenosine, a by-product of the cells' activities [3]. The build-up of adenosine in the brain is thought to be one factor that leads to our perception of being tired [3]. Scientists think that this build-up of adenosine during wakefulness may promote the \"drive to sleep\" [3]. As long as we are awake, adenosine accumulates and remains high [3].

{"chosen":"In almost every state, new cars must be sold through independently owned dealerships. These laws are based on two underlying principles. The first is that allowing automakers to sell cars directly to customers will endanger the businesses of automobile franchisees, which presumably do not have the economic resources to compete with manufacturers on vehicle pricing. The second is that consumers need a knowledgeable, independent sales intermediary who is capable of guiding individuals through the buying process and can later be called on for support in the event [1]. These laws may be influenced by the fact that when a customer buys a car from a dealer, they're not developing a connection to the actual brand. Meanwhile, the salesman at the dealer controls messaging around the car. He typically empathizes car specs and other technical information, even though this information is of little interest to most consumers [2]. It all goes back to the days of Henry Ford when mass vehicle production first began. Back then, it made sense to sell cars through a network of independent dealers.

{"chosen":"Fountains in ancient Rome were able to jet water into the air by using the pressure of water flowing from a higher source of water to create hydraulic head, or force [1]. This force was created by gravity, and the natural slope of the land, which allowed aqueducts to channel water from a freshwater source to a city [3]. The earliest known fountain was a carved stone basin that held precious drinking and religious water [4]. These fountains relied on gravity to control the flow of water from the fountain, and were primarily functional, often situated along aqueducts, streams, and rivers to supply drinking water [4].","rejected":"The ancient Romans had a system of aqueducts that provided the water for the many fountains that were throughout each city.

It was a bill too big to fail, and also too big to read [1]. This bill, however, is an exception to the typical way bills are passed in the United States. Normally, a bill begins as an idea, and then a representative sponsors the bill [2]. The bill is then assigned to a committee for study [2]. If the committee votes to release the bill, it is put on a calendar to be voted on, debated, or amended [2]. If the bill passes by a simple majority (218 of 435), the bill moves to the Senate [2]. In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on [2]. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill [2].

{"chosen":"There are several reasons humans can't run as fast as cars. Humans' main disadvantage is the considerable heft of our limbs, which still suffer from having evolved from apes. [1] Our feet are also a drawback, as we have big, floppy feet to keep us upright, and these extra-large appendages weigh us down. [1] Furthermore, while running, humans spend a greater amount of time on the ground than ostriches, who run on their toes with their ankles a good bit up the leg. [1] Due to the limits of foot-ground contact time, humans' speed is capped, as running faster would require the foot to spend less time on the ground. [2] Therefore, while human runners could theoretically run up to 35 or 40 mph, we are limited by this foot-ground contact time.

Big animals like humans couldn't consume enough energy to maintain a large proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers up and running [2]. Instead, nature has adapted ways of taking longer strides, making foot-ground contact time less critical [2]. This explains adaptations like the elongated legs of an ostrich or the flexible backbone of a cheetah, which \"bends like crazy\" to get the maximum possible distance out of each stride [2].","prompt":"Why is there a limit to how fast we can actually run?

This is possible because the circuits that run the hard drives are powered by real-world logic and allow for complex creations to be built by players [2]. Some people have built working hard drives that can store 1KB or 4KB of data, and while that may not seem like much, one billion of these drives would equal the storage capacity of a typical computer hard drive [2].

A habitat must provide the right conditions for the species to survive, including everything it needs to find and gather food, select a mate, and successfully reproduce [1]. For plants, this means a good habitat must provide the right combination of light, air, water, and soil [1]. A natural habitat is an area of nature, usually a unique self-contained ecosystem, that supports a selection of plants and animals indigenous to the region [2]. Habitats are said to have a suitable arrangement when they have the correct amount of all of the components of a habitat, including shelter, water, food, and space [1]. However, a species can live in a habitat that meets some components of a suitable arrangement, but not all [1]. For example, the Venus Flytrap's native habitat is located in USDA Hardiness Zone 8b, with an average annual minimum temperature of 10 to 15 degrees F (-9.5 to 12.2 degrees C) [3]. This is hardly tropical, and the native Venus Flytrap plant does experience a real winter [3].","rejected":"There are several examples of species that have no native habitat. One example is the Venus fly trap, which was brought to the US from its native range in South America as a form of pest control [1]. Other introduced species have arrived in an area outside their native range by human activity, either deliberate or accidental [2, 4]. Some introduced species are damaging to the ecosystem they are introduced into, while others have no negative effect and can actually be beneficial to humans and ecosystems [2, 4]. Introduced species compete with native species for habitat and food, and often take over specialized ecosystems that rare plants or animals need to survive [5]. Usually, introduced species will not have natural predators, so their numbers will grow alarmingly [5]. The transition from introduction to establishment to invasion has been described in the context of plants [3]. Introduced species are essentially non-native species [2, 3].","prompt":"Is there a species of animals or plants that have no native habitat?\n\nI read the Venus Fly Trap's native home is North Carolina, and was wondering if a species didn't belong anywhere, and could exist anywhere.

As soon as you submerge the air intake, the engine can no longer get air and it will stop running. [1] Any electrical devices like instruments, engine control computers, motors (for fans, windshield wipers, etc.), lights, and the battery must be sealed. Any venting for items such as the crankcase and differential must be sealed (or vented at the same level as the snorkel). The fuel tank must be sealed and vented appropriately. Any chamber or crevice that can fill with water must have a drain. [2] Hybrids and electric cars also have batteries, but they are larger and contain nickel-metal hydride instead of lead-acid.

Finally, 5 percent of lousy singers lack the ability to hear differences in pitch [1]. In tuneless choirs, people aren\u2019t divided into parts, so everyone sings the lead vocals at whatever pitch they can manage [2].

A sheet of flat metal can actually be used to shield parts of your dinner to prevent them from overcooking since they would prevent the microwave energy from actually striking the food.  And when placed under, say, a DiGiorno's frozen pizza, a flat sheet of metal can actually help brown and crisp foods by reflecting additional energy against the bottom of the food. [2][3]  However, certain types of metal such as silverware can conduct electricity and create sparks in the microwave, which could start a fire. [3]  Metal still heats up but without surrounding non-metal molecules to transfer the energy to, the microwaves either bounce off the metal and into the internal circuitry of your microwave, which can result in overheating and possibly fire, or get absorbed by the metal, which can make it super hot.

{"chosen":"During acute stress, the body releases key hormones \u2013 including glucocorticoids (like cortisol), catecholamines (like norepinephrine) and adrenaline \u2013 to prepare itself to fight or flee from danger and to trigger the immune system to step up certain types of surveillance [1].  At the same time, ongoing stress makes us susceptible to illness and disease because the brain sends defense signals to the endocrine system, which then releases an array of hormones that not only gets us ready for emergency situations but severely depresses our immunity at the same time [4]. Some experts claim that stress is responsible for as much as 90% of all illnesses and diseases, including cancer and heart disease [4]. \u201cThe immune system can be viewed as a mechanism that protects the body from foreign invaders, but when the body is under stress, the immune system is suppressed, making the body more susceptible to illness,\u201d explains Pyter [2].

Horses engage in a lot of physical activity and the consequences of this behavior can lead to deteriorated leg bones and increased opportunities to fall[2]. Between 60 to 65 percent of a horse's weight rests on its front legs, so that's where most of its injuries occur[2]. Additionally, because horses depend on their hooves for blood flow, keeping a horse still for a long period of time can be dangerous[4].

When light reflects off of a very smooth surface, the light only reflects in the mirror direction, so the surface looks bright only when viewed from a specific direction,  in this case, the mirror angle.

This builds up a level of confidence that shows and accumulates over time [1]. The real science behind seduction is intuit and understand how a woman's mind works [3]. Seduction, seen negatively, involves temptation and enticement, often sexual in nature, to lead someone astray into a behavioral choice they would not have made if they were not in a state of sexual arousal [5].

{"chosen":"Eddy currents are loops of electrical current induced within conductors by a changing magnetic field in the conductor according to Faraday's law of induction. [1] They can be induced within nearby stationary conductors by a time-varying magnetic field created by an AC electromagnet or transformer, or by relative motion between a magnet and a nearby conductor. [1] The currents generated according to Faraday\u2019s law are known as eddy currents, because they flow, or circulate, in the conductor \u2014 similar to eddies in a body of water. [4] The magnitude of eddy current is directly related to the strength of the magnetic field, the rate of change of the magnetic flux, and the area of the coil, while having an inverse relationship to the resistivity of the conductor. As eddy currents flow through the conductor, heat is generated, referred to as Joule heating. [4] One of the most effective ways to reduce eddy currents in motors is to use laminations, which have a smaller surface area and higher resistance that a solid core. This reduces the magnitude of the eddy currents that can form, and, in turn, the amount of Joule heating that occurs. [4]","rejected":"Eddy currents are currents that circulate in conductors like swirling eddies in a stream. They are induced by changing magnetic fields and flow in closed loops, perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic field. They can be created when a conductor is moving through a magnetic field, or when the magnetic field surrounding a stationary conductor is varying - anything that results in the conductor experiencing a change in the intensity or direction of a magnetic field can produce eddy currents. [1] Like any current flowing through a conductor, an eddy current will produce its own magnetic field. Lenz's Law states that the direction of magnetically induced current, like an eddy current, will be such that the magnetic field produced will oppose the change of magnetic field which created it. This resistance created by the opposing magnetic fields is exploited in eddy current braking, which is commonly used as a method of stopping rotating power tools and rollercoasters.

One such hypothesis is that grunting during an intense physical activity is probably related to communication signals from a particular part of the brain that controls breathing to the particular muscle group that is applying the large physical force. When we push air out forcefully, the brain transmits a signal to the muscle group in question that either decreases inhibition or excites it. The end result is the \u2018oomph\u2019 factor that makes us exert ourselves more forcefully. [2] Another hypothesis is that grunting protects the spine by helping to stabilize the body. As it turns out, grunting does protect your spine too! [3] While performing an intense lifting activity (such as lifting weights in gym), we usually take a breath and hold it in.

Since the only way for a system to become colder is for heat to leave, this means that some heat will inevitably be lost in the form of lost energy [3]. The third law states that in order for a system to become warmer, something like heat or energy has to put in to increase rotation or momentum [2]. Since perpetual motion machines rely on an external source of energy to keep them running, this energy will eventually be lost through friction or the conversion to heat [1, 2, 3].","rejected":"The main reason perpetual motion machines aren't possible is because of the laws of thermodynamics [1, 3].

{"chosen":"Wine tastes better with age because of a complex chemical reaction among sugars, acids, and phenolic compounds that can affect the taste of the wine in a way that gives it a pleasing flavor. The chemical reaction can also change the color and aroma of the spirit, in addition to altering the way the wine feels in the mouth. [1] Red wine contains more tannins than white wine does, particularly red wines with a low pH, such as Pinot Noir and Sangiovese. White wine gets a small amount of tannins from the grapes and acquires more from being aged in wooden barrels. [2] Tannins are a natural preservative and can keep a bottle of wine palatable for 40 years or longer. When a wine is young, its tannins give it a bitter and astringent flavor, but in time the tannins dissipate, and the body of the wine develops its own \"bouquet,\" or aroma and essence. The bouquet improves over time, imparting a more complex and subtle flavor to the wine.

Furthermore, much alcohol was locally brewed or distilled, and thus regulation of \"interstate commerce\" would not have been sufficient to prohibit alcohol completely [2]. Thus, a Constitutional amendment was the only way to create a nationwide law banning alcohol sale and distribution in general [2]. The war on drugs has been fought largely with laws that were beyond Congress's powers to enact [3]. Although it took a constitutional amendment to allow Congress to prohibit alcohol nationwide, the prohibition of now-illicit substances under the Controlled Substances Act took place without any such amendment [3]. This is perhaps mainly a commentary on the Supreme Court's expansive reading of the Commerce Clause, but it should give pause to anyone who takes the Constitution seriously [3,4].

That router bounces it to another router, and so on, until it reaches the server. The server sends information back to your IP address the same way [3]. You may connect to the Internet using a modem and dial a local number to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) [4]. At work, you may be part of a local area network (LAN), but you most likely still connect to the Internet using an ISP that your company has contracted with [4].

{"chosen":"There are two main types of reflection: specular reflection, which occurs when light bounces off a smooth, shiny surface like glass or water, and diffuse reflection, which occurs when light hits an object and reflects in lots of different directions [1]. Most of the things we see are because light has reflected off them [1]. Generally, glass that is clear or tinted has a very thin layer of metal or metallic oxide on the surface, which serves as a reflective coating [2]. The reflective coating can be applied during the float process [2]. It reduces heat gain and glare from the outside while allowing visible light to enter [2].","rejected":"There are two main reasons that glass surfaces are typically reflective. First, polished shiny surfaces reflect light because they have a even surface and reflect most of the light rays parallel to each other. [1] Second, the best reflectors are very smooth, such as mirrors and polished metals. [2] On the other hand, dull and dark surfaces such as dark fabrics do not reflect light well. [3] There are two mechanisms for reflection. When an electromagnetic wave goes through a good conductor, such as a shiny metal, the electrons on the surface move to allow the wave to pass through. As a result, the wave is reflected off the surface. [4] On the other hand, transparent insulators, such as air, glass, and water, can still produce reflection due to the induced movement of electrons, but it is more complicated and harder to understand and explain.

{"chosen":"Ancient Rome had aqueducts that carried water down from the mountains to elevated cisterns where it was stored. All water flowed to the city by gravity, but because it was arriving from surrounding hills, it could be stored in large cisterns. [1, 2] Fountains served both decorative and functional purposes, since people could bring their buckets to the fountain to collect water. The cisterns provided the height needed to generate water pressure for the fountains to spray. One foot of height generates 0.43 pounds per square inch (psi) of water pressure, so a cistern does not have to be that tall.

Until the late 19th century, most fountains operated by gravity, and needed a source of water higher than the fountain, such as a reservoir or aqueduct, to make the water flow or jet into the air [1, 2, 3]. The gravity pressured aqueducts could produce high reaching water works, in the same way that a modern water tower works [2]. The height at which the water is held compounds. For each foot of height the water is held at, the potential water pressure increases [2]. That is how fountains in ancient Rome operated [2]. The earliest known fountain was a carved stone basin that held precious drinking and religious, ceremonial water and is believed to be from around 2000 BC [4]. Early fountains used in ancient civilizations relied on gravity to control the flow of water from the fountain [4].","prompt":"How were people in the past able to create fountains shooting upward without the use of electricity?\n\nWith no device to draw water in and push it upwards with pressure how did pre-electricity fountains work?"}

It is also important to shave with the grain [2]. Shaving in the direction your hair grows will help prevent ingrown hairs that could contribute to acne and skin irritation, which in turn make it harder to shave without cutting yourself [2]. Another reason shaving razors do not cut your skin is due to shaving gels which work to provide a protective layer between the skin and blades - reducing any friction and encouraging a smoother stroke of the razor [6].

For color films, negatives have to be created that produce the three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. Negatives of these colors are created using another set of familiar primary colors: cyan, magenta, and yellow [2]. Once exposed, latent images are developed, stopped, washed, fixed, and washed again in much the same way black and white film is developed [3].

Aconite, also called monkshood and wolfsbane, was another poison known to the ancients; in testimony from an 1882 English murder trial, a medical examiner who'd tasted it reported that it created a burning and numbing sensation in the mouth - similar to the taste, he said, of an extract he'd made from the victim's organs [2]. Strychnine, used medicinally in Asia for centuries, wasn't identified by Western science until the early 1800s; with its bitter taste and tendency (in high enough doses) to cause dramatically convulsive death, strychnine was an effective way to kill but an ineffective way to not get caught [2].","rejected":"We typically know the taste of poisons because we typically know what we are dealing with.

{"chosen":"The practice of smashing a bottle of champagne against a ship's exterior prior to its launch dates back to 1891 when Britain's Queen Victoria launched a Navy cruiser named HMS Royal Arthur [3]. The custom of \"christening\" ships by breaking a bottle of wine over the bow stems from the traditions of royal representatives at ship launching ceremonies throughout the ages [3]. In 15th-century England, the representatives would drink from a silver goblet of wine aboard the vessel, pour a splash on the deck, and then throw their goblet overboard [3]. Although unlikely, the Queen could have used any type of alcohol since wine was the customary drink of choice for ship launching ceremonies. In the 18th century, the Royal Navy was launching so many new vessels that throwing away a silver goblet with each new launch became too expensive. As a cheaper alternative, the Navy turned to smashing wine bottles instead [3]. Eventually, champagne was used due to its association with celebration. The pressurized bottles provide a much more impressive explosion on impact [3].","rejected":"It's a nautical tradition dating back thousands of years to accompany the physical process of transferring a vessel to the water with ceremonies [1].

Lauric acid is absorbed more slowly and metabolized like other long-chain fatty acids. So the health benefits reported from a specially constructed MCT coconut oil that contains medium-chain triglycerides other than lauric acid cannot be applied directly to commercial coconut oils.

[2]  In a meta-analysis of 16 clinical trials, coconut oil was found to increase both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels in participants, compared with nontropical vegetable oils (e.g., sunflower, canola, olive). [3] Coconut oil increased total cholesterol by about 15 points, LDL by 10 points, and HDL by 4 points.

One factor is movement and orientation, since the dream unfolds while the dreamer is at rest and horizontal [1]. Upon waking, too much movement can disrupt the mind's memory of the dream scene [1]. Another factor is that the electrical signals and chemical signatures that constitute the experience of the dream may disappear as wakefulness ensues, like a message written on a fogged mirror that vanishes as the steam evaporates [2]. Particularly memorable dreams may create an impression that persists for decades, but it is also common to wake up in the morning out of a longer phase of REM-sleep, which often causes dreams to be forgotten [3, 4].

{"chosen":"Radiation causes mutations in animals and humans by ionizing their DNA [1]. Ionization means the radiation strips the electrons from the surrounding molecules, including DNA [1, 4]. This loss of electrons creates water-derived radicals that oxidize molecules, including DNA, resulting in DNA breaks [1,4]. These breaks, especially the double stranded ones, result in faulty DNA replication that causes mutations [1]. In humans, radiation may alter the DNA within any cell, causing cell damage and death that result from mutations in somatic cells only in the organism in which the mutation occurred and are therefore termed somatic or nonheritable effects [3]. However, genetic effects can occur in germ cells (sperm and ova) that can be transmitted to future generations and are therefore called genetic or heritable effects [3]. The genetic effects of radiation do not produce the visible monstrosities of science fiction; they simply produce a greater frequency of the same mutations that occur continuously and spontaneously in nature [3].","rejected":"Radiation can be seen as a package of energy.

The blue wavelengths of light are scattered, similar to the scattering of blue light in the sky but absorption is a much larger factor than scattering for the clear ocean water. In water, absorption is strong in the red and weak in the blue, thus red light is absorbed quickly in the ocean leaving blue.

{"chosen":"The physiology of a one-punch knockout can be explained quite simply [3]. The blow to the skull jostles the brain in its lake of cerebral-spinal fluid [3]. Depending on the power of the punch, the brain is slammed back and forth against the front and back or sides of the skull [3]. In response to this brain trauma, the central nervous system does a \"re-boot\" of the body systems to remove the body from the line of fire and restore blood flow and proper brain chemistry [3]. This period of unconsciousness can last a few seconds to several minutes [3]. A punch to the jaw causes the head to suddenly spin around [1]. This quick motion of causes trauma to the brain that knocks the recipient out leaving them unconscious [1]. Points on the jaw that are especially vulnerable to knockouts are the sides of the chin, and where the jaw is attaches to the skull [1].","rejected":"It's not necessarily true that a hit to the jaw necessarily causes a knockout. The reason that a hit to the jaw, particularly the side of the jaw under the ear, causes a blackout is because the head is suddenly spun around, causing trauma to the brain [3]. Typically, you knock someone out when you cause their head to snap to the side, which causes the brain to hit the side of the skull, triggering a blackout [1, 3]. The actual point of contact is not the jaw itself, but rather the chin or jaw attached to the skull [4]. The jaw is a semi-circular bone that attaches to the skull at the temporomandibular joint, which allows the mouth to open and close and is felt just in front of the ear [2]. When hit in the jaw, the diagnosis of concussion may be very easy to make or it may be challenging [2]. A common strategy in boxing is to aim for the chin or jaw, which causes the most head movement and sends the brain into a frenzy, causing a quicker knockout [4].","prompt":"How does a hit to the corner of the jaw knock someone out?

Even if they did, basing borders on geography was prone to create disputes. The inaccuracy of surveys aside, natural twists and turns of geographic features, especially rivers are source of major headaches.

It can also have a strong multiplier effect overall under the best conditions [2]. However, there are several caveats to this. One is that infrastructure construction projects may take a few quarters or a few years to get off the ground due to implementation lag [2]. Another is that infrastructure spending is usually for a specific budgeted amount to fund specific projects, and cost over-runs and other issues can drag this out [3]. Additionally, infrastructure spending tends to target the heavy construction industry, which may or may not be particularly hard hit in any given recession [3]. There may also be tension between the goal of economic stimulus and actual public need for the infrastructure because infrastructure spending is often heavily influenced by political and electoral considerations rather than either of these two goals [3].","rejected":"Infrastructure investment stimulates the economy in the short term, increases economic productivity in the long term, and strengthens communities [1].

Additionally, it can support lower addiction rates and substance abuse rates [5]. However, the drawbacks include non-violent dangers to society that would likely increase, like used needles being left in public spaces which creates a disease and injury risk to anyone in the area, particularly children [3].

{"chosen":"The answer as to why all major objects in the solar system, including the planets, asteroid belts, and Kuiper belt objects, orbit in the same direction is because of gravity and angular momentum [1, 2, 3, 5]. When the solar system formed, a massive cloud of dust started contracting towards a gravitational center. The more the cloud collapsed in on itself, the greater the angular momentum became, causing the cloud to spin faster and faster [4, 5]. This faster rotation eventually flattened the cloud into a disk, with the Sun at the center of the disk and all of the planets forming in the plane of the disk [4, 5]. Because all of the planets, asteroid belts, and Kuiper belt objects formed in this solar system, they all orbit in the same direction [2]. Beyond the solar system, beyond the planets, beyond the asteroids, beyond the Kuiper belt, and beyond the comet belt, beyond the plane of the solar system, beyond the disk of the galaxy, beyond the accretion disks of black holes, there is perfect order [3].

{"chosen":"There are a few reasons why white flour is more common than whole-grain flour. One reason is that whole-wheat flour includes the bran, endosperm, and germ of the wheat grain, which gives it a slightly darker color and makes it more nutritious [1]. The refining process associated with making white flour separates the fiber-rich brain from the rest of the grain, so white flour typically contains less fiber than its whole-grain counterpart [2]. The upper classes during the middle ages liked the texture of white flour and thought it was more healthy than whole wheat flour [3]. The presence of the germ also decreases the shelf life of flour [1]. As a result, manufacturers found that they could make more money by offering a very shelf-stable product by removing the bran and the germ and bleaching the flour [3]. Since the 1940\u2019s there have been laws in place to require enriching this flour with vitamins because of the health problems that were linked to consumption of unenriched white flour [3].","rejected":"The difference between whole wheat and white flour is that white flour is made up of only the endosperm portion of the wheat, which has the downside of removing many of the grain's nutrients. This is done to allow white flour to be sold cheaply, as modern wheat roller milling machines are fast and tough, built for mass production [1]. White flour can be bleached with sa to make it look pure and clean, and the absence of the germ increases its shelf life [1]. Whole wheat flour includes the bran, endosperm, and germ of the wheat grain, which lends it a darker color and increases its nutritional value [2]. It is often stone milled to protect the bran and germ, and the presence of the germ decreases its shelf life, which is why it is harder to find [2].

One is the type of food you ate: Meals that contain a greater proportion of protein tend to induce greater feelings of fullness than meals with greater proportions of carbs or fat, even when their calorie counts are similar [1]. Higher protein meals stimulate the release of fullness hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), cholecystokinin (CCK), and peptide YY (PYY) [2].

When a female horse and a male donkey mate, the mule offspring gets 32 chromosomes from its mother horse and 31 chromosomes from its father donkey [2]. This prevents the mule from creating gametes [1]. In order to create gametes, an organism must undergo meiosis, a type of cell division that creates eggs and sperm [3]. During meiosis, diploid cells, which have two matching sets of chromosomes, divide into haploid cells, which have only one set of chromosomes [3]. The haploid cells then divide again to create an embryo [3]. In mules, meiosis might fail to progress because the chromosomes do not align properly in stage one of meiosis [3].","rejected":"Mules are sterile because they have an odd number of chromosomes, this is due to a horse having 64 chromosomes and a donkey having 62 chromosomes, this prevents the mule from creating gametes [5].

Secondly, being a morning person or night owl is partly due to genes, since melatonin (the sleep hormone) levels are likely to rise earlier in the evening and fall earlier in the morning for morning people, compared to night owls [2]. Morning people also have the added problem of early morning awakenings, which is defined as difficulty falling or staying asleep and is frequently associated with early morning awakenings [3]. The reason for this is that the ability to sleep is linked to two processes: the homeostatic sleep drive, which is the gradual desire for sleep that builds the longer a person stays awake, and relates to the gradual accumulation of a chemical called adenosine in the brain [3].

{"chosen":"Your mind can be a powerful healing tool when given the chance. The idea that your brain can convince your body a fake treatment is the real thing \u2014 the so-called placebo effect \u2014 and thus stimulate healing has been around for millennia [1]. Now science has found that under the right circumstances, a placebo can be just as effective as traditional treatments [1,2]. For years, a placebo effect was considered a sign of failure. A placebo is used in clinical trials to test the effectiveness of treatments and is most often used in drug studies [2]. For example, people in one group get the tested drug, while the others receive a fake drug, or placebo, that they think is the real thing [2]. This way, the researchers can measure if the drug works by comparing how both groups react [2]. If they both have the same reaction \u2014 improvement or not \u2014 the drug is deemed not to work [2]. Experts have concluded that reacting to a placebo is not proof that a certain treatment doesn't work, but rather that another, non-pharmacological mechanism may be present [2]. Placebos can work for conditions that are defined by \"self-observation\" symptoms like pain, nausea, or fatigue [3] [1].  ","rejected":"The placebo effect works because people believe that a fake treatment will help them. If they believe that a placebo pill will reduce their pain, then it probably will, even if the pill is actually a placebo.

A coup is when a group seizes power from the government through violence or non-violent means [2], and an insurgency is an armed effort to overthrow a government and replace it with another [4]. The distinction between a civil war and a revolution is that the latter is almost always directed against the current government, whereas civil wars can be fought among different factions, and may or may not involve the government as one of the fighting parties [1][3].

Another type of anti-aliasing is called spatial anti-aliasing, the technique of minimizing aliasing when representing a high-resolution image at a lower resolution [2]. To be sure that the frequency content of the input signal is limited, a low pass filter (a filter that passes low frequencies but attenuates the high frequencies) is added before the sampler and the ADC [3]. This filter is an anti-alias filter because by attenuating the higher frequencies (greater than the Nyquist frequency), it prevents the aliasing components from being sampled [3]. Although you want to pass only signals with frequencies < f1, those signals in the transition band could still cause aliasing [4]. Thus, the sampling frequency should be greater than two times the highest frequency in the transition band [4].","prompt":"Anti-Aliasing\n\nIs it better to have it on or off?

{"chosen":"A Van de Graaff generator is a type of electrostatic generator that uses a moving belt that accumulates charge on a hollow metal structure designed like a globe, placed on the top of a column that is insulating in nature and thus, creating a very high electric potential in the order of a few million volts [3]. This results in a very large electric field that is used to accelerate charged particles [3]. The belt\u2019s charge is increased by the lower brush assembly. The electrons in the metal teeth of the brush are attracted to the strong positive charge of the lower roller, so those electrons concentrate in the tips of the teeth, which are closer to the roller [4]. The electric field at these tips becomes so intense that the electrons in nearby air molecules are torn apart from the positive nuclei with which they normally associate by repulsive and attractive forces [4]. This results in a conductive form of matter known as corona discharge or plasma [4]. Some of the freed electrons in the plasma may then become linked to neutral molecules of air, making the molecules negative, and positive air molecules can capture electrons from the metal teeth [4].","rejected":"A Van de Graaff generator is a giant device with a large metallic ball on top of a column.

[1] Van de Graaff generators produce and store electrical volts of the same charge to create static electricity. Big rubber bands move over a piece of felt, stripping away its electrons. The electrons move up the rubber band to the metal ball and into the person whose hand is placed on the generator as part of the experiment.

A primary reason is that women have more fat sitting directly under the skin than men do, which is determined by estrogen and the presence of the second X chromosome in females [1]. This difference may play a role in cardiovascular disease [1]. Another difference is that men are taller than women, which means they have more cells and burn more energy, which could add to wear and tear of the tissues themselves [5]. Historically, medical advances have affected men and women differently, and smoking habits among men have affected mortality patterns [2]. Finally, there are differences in the chromosomes each cell contains [4]. Women keep double copies of every gene, meaning they have a spare if one is faulty, whereas men don't have that back-up [4]. This may cause more cells to malfunction with time, putting men at greater risk of disease [4].","rejected":"On average, females live longer than males. A number of different factors could be contributing to this. One factor is that females tend to have less visceral fat, which is fat that surrounds the organs.

[3] Another factor is that males are more likely to smoke, drink excessively, be overweight, and take risks, which can lead to premature death.

In a general sense, entropy is the measure of disorder in a closed system [3]. In the second law of thermodynamics, entropy in a system almost always increases over time [3]. Work can be done to create order in a system, but even the work put into reordering increases disorder as a byproduct, usually in the form of heat [3]. It is possible for entropy to decrease in a system on occasion, but that is statistically very unlikely [3]. In a more technical sense, entropy is the general trend of the universe toward death and disorder [2]. This notion was initially postulated by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1800s [4]. For example, melting a block of ice means taking a highly structured and orderly system of water molecules and converting it into a disorderly liquid in which molecules have no fixed positions [4]. There is a large increase in entropy in the process [4].","rejected":"In simple terms, entropy is a scientific concept and a measurable physical property most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty [1, 5].

This means that the \"multiplicity\", or number of ways a system can be arranged, will never decrease, and that the system will naturally tend to higher disorder [5].

{"chosen":"There are several reasons power lines sag between poles. First, tension exists in a string that is experiencing two forces in opposite directions [1]. Thus, a cable hanging on a pole is under tension and would experience more tension if the cables were pulled tight, which could lead to the cables being cut when little expansion or contraction occurs [1]. Second, heat is dissipated during the transmission of electricity, and the cables are a little loose to minimize heat [1]. If the cables were made tight and the weather got cold, the cables would contract, thereby creating more tension that could lead to cable damage [2]. Third, various mechanical loads, such as ice, snow, wind, and contaminants, can put pressure on the wires, poles, insulators, or pole top hardware, causing the increased sag [5]. If the wires are not in good repair or the way they are connected to the insulator is unsound, electricity can leak, leading to increases in electrical loads on the hardware. Increased thermal loads from freeze\/thaw cycles or current leakage can also cause destructive strains that lead to infrastructure failure [5].","rejected":"There are engineering tables that give formulas for how much sag and tension a given span of lines between poles should have so they don't snap and so they don't hang too low and endanger the public [1]. If there is less tension, the wires will be looser and vice versa [1]. In hot weather, power lines can overheat and the conductors expand, creating more slack between transmission line structures, causing them to sag [2].  Additionally, power lines can sag due to a variety of other reasons, including if they require repair or adjustment, or were improperly installed, or if there are mechanical loads, such as gravity, wind, ice, snow, or contaminants that put pressure on the wires, poles, insulators, or pole top hardware [3].

For example, the wealthy think of Real Estate not in terms of their own homes, but rather property that will put money into their pockets, such as rental properties, houses, condos, strip malls, and self-storage units [1]. They are able to borrow money to buy these assets because, in essence, these are also someone else's liabilities [3]. As for vehicles, the wealthy may own them outright, borrow money to buy them, or lease them [2]. However, people should consider the bank's perspective when evaluating whether a mortgage or other loan is an asset or a liability. From the bank's point of view, a mortgage is an asset because they can borrow the money at a profit by loaning it out at a higher interest rate [4].

{"chosen":"Fighter pilots pass out due to the maximum g-force experienced when accelerating or decelerating quickly [1]. This force causes the pilots blood pressure to change and the flow of oxygen to the brain to decrease [1]. Additionally, the pressure outside the pilot's body is greater than what they are normally accustomed to, which causes the blood to flow out of the brain and into the lower extremities [1]. To prevent blackouts, pilots tense their muscles to keep blood pumping in the heart and brain [3]. However, faulty equipment has also caused pilots to experience hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, which results in lightheadedness, tingliness, and numbness [4].","rejected":"Fighter pilots are able to pass out from doing intense turns with high amounts of g-forces because the force of gravity is multiplied [1, 3].

This force of acceleration can be anywhere from 4 to 6 g, and if this force is sustained for more than a few seconds, the resulting symptoms range from visual impairment to total blackout [1, 2]. The reason the force of acceleration can be so high is because the pilot is pushing air out of his or her lungs against a closed glottis while simultaneously contracting the muscles in the calves, thighs, and shoulders [5]. This prevents blood from flowing away from the brain, which minimizes the risk of the pilot passing out [5, 6].","prompt":"Why can fighter pilots pass out from doing intense turns with high amounts of g-forces?\n\nWhy does having the oxygen masks as a apparatus stop this from happening as well?"}

{"chosen":"Plant biomass is elevated at the equator due to climate factors. The climate is warm and wet, enabling photosynthesis to proceed at a high rate, allowing enzymes to work most efficiently, and allowing stomata to remain open without the risk of excessive transpiration [1]. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide moving into the plant is maximal, resulting in high biomass production. In contrast, dry and cold environments have lower photosynthetic rates and therefore less biomass [1]. In addition, the distribution and abundance of plants are affected by inorganic nutrients, namely nitrogen and phosphorus, which plants obtain from the soil when water moves into the plant through the roots [2]. Soil structure (particle size of soil components), soil pH, and soil nutrient content play an important role in plant distribution and abundance [2].","rejected":"Plants near the equator have evolved to survive the extreme conditions of high UV light, intense heat and humidity, and long periods of wetness [2][3]. These conditions are poor for the survivability of many species, thus resulting in a greater variety of species in the tropics [2].

However, veterans themselves report that their transition from military to civilian life is made more difficult by a lack of strong professional networks and a culture of treating veterans as charity cases [2]. It is also common for veterans to experience homelessness, with 5.6 percent of all veterans referred for mental health services experiencing homelessness within the following 12 months [1]. This risk is strongly linked to age, with veterans aged 46 to 55 years being most likely to become homeless [1]. Additionally, veterans who receive other-than-honorable or dishonorable discharges are often prevented from receiving federal benefits through the Department of Veterans Affairs [4]. Their discharge status may also make it more difficult for them to find proper housing, health care, and employment [4].","rejected":"One reason that some wounded veterans get robotic limbs, smart homes, trained dogs, and other luxuries is that many veterans struggle with economic hardship and mental health issues, making it difficult for them to obtain stable employment and housing [1, 3].

It occurs when hard water, which contains calcium and magnesium-containing minerals, is boiled [1, 2]. When the water boils, these minerals do not evaporate and are left behind in the kettle [1]. As the water continues to boil, the naturally occurring calcium carbonate minerals begin to reform to their solid form, which is limescale [1, 2]. Limescale can also occur in water that has a permanent hardness, which is caused by calcium and magnesium sulfates that are not removed by boiling the water [2].","rejected":"The white chalky residue that builds up on the bottom of kettles is most likely caused by calcium and magnesium-containing minerals in hard water [1, 2, 3].

Heating or boiling hard water in a kettle will soften it by precipitating the calcium carbonate as its solubility decreases with increasing temperature [2]. This calcium carbonate could be the white powder you observed after evaporation [2]. Hard water should not pose any health risks, and in fact it can add some extra calcium and magnesium to your diet [2]. To prevent limescale from building up in your kettle, it requires regular maintenance, such as emptying the kettle out after each use, rinsing and drying it thoroughly, and using a water softener [3].","prompt":"Why does my water kettle always have a build up of white particles on the bottom?

When the body is positioned horizontally, you can immediately notice that your pulse rate drops [1]. This is because if blood is pumped at the same level for a prolonged period of time, it will cause pressure on the brain [1]. Scientists also believe that sleeping with your head in the east is the best direction because it improves memory and overall health [2]. This position is also good for you if you are in a stressful profession because it helps make you feel fresh faster [2]. On the other hand, sleeping with your head toward north is extremely harmful, especially if your feet points to the south and your head points to the north [2]. The position makes you have terrible dreams and disrupts your sleep [2]. It also decreases your positive vibrations, and there will be a 50% decrease in your soul power and willpower [2].","rejected":"Sleeping in an unfamiliar or unnatural sleep position interferes with the quality of your sleep [1]. Each sleep position can influence your dreams \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 and your overall sleep [1]. On your side, sleeping laterally is the most common sleep position [1]. Studies have found that right-side sleepers experienced more positive dreams and fewer nightmares than left-side sleepers [1]. For people with heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), doctors say the left side is best [1]. Sleeping on the left side keeps your stomach below your esophagus, and gravity may help with reflux, while sleeping on your right side may cause you to dream of swallowing or burning [1]. On your back, sleeping supine, or on your back, may lead to lower back pain, and it could cause other problems that may alter your dreams [1]. The face-up position may lead to snoring, encourage sleep apnea, and interfere with restful sleep [1].

{"chosen":"The process of capturing a moment in time with a camera works differently depending on whether it is a digital or film camera [1, 2]. With a digital camera, when you press the button to take a photograph, an aperture opens at the front of the camera and light streams in through the lens [2]. Unlike film cameras, however, there is no film in a digital camera [2]. Instead, there is a piece of electronic equipment that captures the incoming light rays and turns them into electrical signals [2]. This light detector is called an image sensor, and it breaks the incoming light up into millions of pixels [1, 2, 3]. The sensor measures the color and brightness of each pixel and stores it as a number [3]. Your digital photograph is effectively an enormously long string of numbers describing the exact details of each pixel it contains [3]. In contrast, with a film camera, light from the thing you are photographing zooms into the camera lens, which in turn strikes a frame of film [3, 4]. The film captures the light and a computer built inside the camera reads how much energy is being produced [1]. The computer is then able to estimate the colors in the scene by looking at what other nearby pixels registered [1]. Put simply,","rejected":"A camera works by combining an optical element (the lens), a chemical element (the film), and a mechanical element (the camera body itself). [1] The optical component of the camera is the lens, which takes the beams of light bouncing off of an object and redirects them so they come together to form a real image - an image that looks just like the scene in front of the lens. [2] A still film camera is made of three basic elements: an optical element (the lens), a chemical element (the film) and a mechanical element (the camera body itself). The only trick to photography is calibrating and combining these elements in such a way that they record a crisp, recognizable image. [1] \nThe in-camera metering measures reflected light, which is the light reflecting from your subject.

There are other programs that can do many of the same things as Photoshop, such as GIMP and PaintShop Pro, but they are not as fast or as refined as Photoshop [3, 4]. Photoshop also has a variety of specialized tools not found in other programs, such as the Face-Aware Liquify feature for adjusting photos of people [4]. Affinity Photo, though not as refined as Photoshop, is a capable competitor and has support for many of the same features [3].","rejected":"There are several reasons that Photoshop has a monopoly on image manipulation software. One reason is that Adobe has kept the price of Photoshop fairly consistent over the years, while offering cheaper, limited packages for non-professional users [2]. Another reason is that, unlike some cheaper alternatives, Photoshop is designed for professional use and can be difficult to get to grips with [2]. Photoshop files are also very large, and the programs numerous special functions add to the high demands that the software places on hardware [2]. Affinity Photo is the best overall alternative to Photoshop, according to Tom's Guide, although it costs more than the lite version of Photoshop [3].

The two modems would \"handshake\" by performing a process where they would test the waters and negotiate settings, such as which speed and compression methods to use [2]. Modems were originally designed to allow you to send data over a network that was designed to only carry voice [3]. Since the phone system could now carry both voice and data at the same time, the sound was no longer needed [3]. The speaker was also turned on by default to give the user feedback that something was happening during the handshake [4]. With the proper setup of the AT commands, you could have the modem speaker always on, totally silent during operation, or default with the speaker turned on during connect [4].","rejected":"The noise that modems made when connecting to the internet was the sound of data being sent and received. [1] The two modems would \"handshake\" at the beginning of the connection, negotiating settings.

{"chosen":"Popcorn kernels contain oil and water with starch, surrounded by a hard and strong outer coating [2]. When popcorn is heated, the water inside the kernel tries to expand into steam, but it cannot escape through the seed coat (the popcorn hull or pericarp) [2]. The hot oil and steam gelatinizes the starch inside the popcorn kernel, making it softer and more pliable [2]. When the popcorn reaches a temperature of 180 C (356 F), the pressure inside the kernel is around 135 psi (930 kPa), which is sufficient pressure to rupture the popcorn hull, essentially turning the kernel inside-out [1, 2]. The pressure inside the kernel is released very quickly, expanding the proteins and starch inside the popcorn kernel into a foam, which cools and sets into the familiar popcorn puff [2].","rejected":"Heat causes popcorn kernels to pop because it causes the water trapped inside the kernels to turn to steam. The steam is pushed past the boiling point by the pressurized environment created by the hull [2]. As the kernel continues to heat, the pressure eventually exceeds the strength of the hull, causing it to rupture [2]. The pressurized steam within the kernel immediately expands, turning the soft starch inside the kernel into inflated balls and forcing the hard starch outer layer to give way, causing the kernel to explode [1].","prompt":"Why does heat make popcorn pop?"}

Java was stuck in the middle of two major issues during its time, the memory issue and the no-console-VM issue [1]. The memory issue was that Java could not run correctly on systems with less than 3 GB of RAM, which was a major fault in the eyes of game developers [1]. The second issue was that there was no VM on any console, which hindered portability and deployment [1]. Regarding the speed of Java, it is comparable to C++ in many scientific computing benchmarks and performs just as well in terms of memory usage [2]. Java does have a bit of a startup time, but this is inconsequential in the grand scheme of things, especially in a game [2]. When it comes to coding in Java, the general consensus is that it is overly complicated and over-engineered in many parts, which can cause issues with development and slowing down the process [3].

One reason was to do a surprise attack on Germany. Also the Allied forces needed to gain land to stop the Germans from invading farther inland. They needed to do that so Germany did not come and attack them. Also they wanted to gain France back [2]. The Allies put a lot of effort into trying to convince the Germans that the invasion was going to be near Calais, not Normandy. They invented phantom field armies based in Kent as part of their D-Day deception plan, named Operation Fortitude [3].

Once the juice had been squeezed, these companies proceeded to remove any lingering oxygen, which allowed the liquid to keep for up to a year without spoiling [2]. However, removing the oxygen also removed the natural flavors from the oranges, which meant Tropicana and other massive juice manufacturers had to add so-called flavor packs to their now-flavorless, but ever-enduring OJ [2]. Second, Tropicana added chemically engineered \"flavor packs\" to its juice, making it taste the same year-round [3]. The orange juice lawsuits are just the latest disputes over \"all natural\" claims [3].

After surgery, both the donor's and recipient's liver will grow to the size of normal livers [5].","rejected":"The liver has incredible regenerative potential, replacing lost cells rapidly due to its ability to regenerate without help from outside sources [1, 2, 3]. However, this regenerative capacity is limited if the liver cells are unable to cling to a connective tissue \"scaffold\" in order to preserve the normal architecture of the liver [1]. If a region of the liver is removed, this scaffold goes too, and there is nothing to guide regenerating cells to the correct locations [1]. As a result, removing a lobe of the liver to cure a cancer or as a donor organ does not result in the regrowth of the excised lobe [2]. However, if only a small portion of the liver is damaged, the liver is capable of replacing the dead cells with new cells within a month [3].","prompt":"If the liver can regenerate so quickly when a piece is removed, can a piece of diseased liver be cut off so that a normal piece will grow in its place?"}

For example, it is legal for TIME (the magazine), SHELL (the energy giant), and CATERPILLAR (the equipment manufacturer) to have trademark registrations for these words [1]. However, the USPTO might reject trademark applications for common phrases under certain circumstances [2]. In 2014, the USPTO rejected nine applications for the phrase BOSTON STRONG, which grew from the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing [2]. They decided similarly in 2002 when many companies filed trademark applications for the term \"LET'S ROLL\", which was associated with the passengers on United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001 [2]. Phrases that become popular during news events are not the only common words and phrases the USPTO might reject [2]. In 2007, the USPTO rejected a trademark application for the word PODCAST [2].

{"chosen":"There are several reasons why the sun, and more specifically, being sunburned can make you feel tired. First, sun exposure increases body temperature. [1] The body will try to cool itself down by increasing the heart rates or the metabolic system. [1] All these changes in the body will make us feel tired and sleepy after sun exposure. [1] Furthermore, it is believed that sun exposure suppresses the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate the sleep cycle. [2] Since UV rays damage the skin, your immune system also kicks in to try to protect you against sun exposure. The immune system is typically restored during sleep, so increased work by the immune system can make you feel sleepy. [3]","rejected":"Sunburns make you tired because they expose you to ultraviolet (UV) rays, which can make you feel tired in the short term, and chronic exposure to the sun can increase the risk of skin cancer [1]. To protect itself against the sun's UV rays, the skin synthesises melanin, the dark pigment responsible for what is referred to as a tan [2]. Since UV rays damage the skin, your immune system also kicks in to try to protect you against sun exposure. The immune system is typically restored during sleep, so increased work by the immune system can make you feel sleepy [2]. In addition, your body has to work harder to keep your core body temperature regulated as you get sunburned, as even a small change in core temperature makes the body function less efficiently [3]. As a result, you may find yourself dehydrated as well as sleepy after spending time in the sun, as even mild dehydration can alter your mood, including making you feel fatigued [3]. Moreover, if you happen to get a sunburn during the day, your body will divert fluid to the skin's surface and away from the rest of the body, which can make it harder for you to sweat and therefore stay hydrated [4].","prompt":"why when you get sunburned you get sleepy\/tired?\n\nWhen you get sunburned it seems to make you tired, why?"}

Additionally, the five most common signs of cancer in young people are: lumps, bumps and swellings; unexplained tiredness; mole changes; pain; and significant weight change [2]. Other symptoms to watch out for include headaches or dizziness that won't go away, getting out of breath more easily than normal, bleeding that you can't explain, and ongoing changes when you go for a poo -- like constipation or diarrhea (or both), pain, or feeling like you've not quite finished going [2, 4]. It's also important to remember that these symptoms don't necessarily mean that you have cancer, but it's best to get checked out [2].","rejected":"The early symptoms of cancer can sometimes overlap with those of much more common illnesses or injuries [1]. Young people may feel run down, get sick, or have bumps or bruises that could mask the early signs of cancer [1]. The most common signs of cancer in young adults are a new lump or mass that is often hard and painless, although some cancers are soft, tender, or even painful [6]. Some additional warning signs for cancer are an unusual lump or swelling, especially in the neck, breast, belly, or testicle; unexplained tiredness and loss of energy; easy bruising; abnormal bleeding; ongoing pain in one part of the body; unexplained fever or illness [1].

{"chosen":"There are two main reasons why the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles are not backwards compatible. The first reason is that the new consoles use different chip architectures than the previous ones [1, 2]. The previous PlayStation and Xbox consoles used PowerPC chips, whereas the PS4 and Xbox One use an x86-64 architecture, which is similar to Intel and AMD CPUs [2]. While backwards compatibility is doable with the right amount of effort and resources, making older games compatible with the new architecture would be too complex and time-consuming [1, 2]. The second reason is that the software emulation needed to make older games work on the new consoles is incredibly hard, especially considering that the new consoles have many times the frequency of the previous ones [3]. In addition, the move could potentially alienate some of the PlayStation and Xbox customers who are not interested in old games but want to play the latest titles [1]. With that in mind, both Sony and Microsoft have invested significant resources into their respective streaming services, which allow players to rent or purchase old games on demand [4].","rejected":"Backwards compatibility for video game consoles used to be a common feature, but has become less common over time as the new consoles tend to focus on new features and developing new technology instead of compatibility with older consoles [3]. The problem with providing backwards compatibility is that it is becoming more and more complex as new generations of video game systems come out and it is taking more and more resources to support old platforms [1, 3]. For the most part, only Nintendo has continued to provide significant backwards compatibility with its systems, with the Wii U continuing to support previous Wii systems [3]. Sony and Microsoft have elected to instead focus on new technology, such as allowing gamers to stream older titles through a service called Gaikai on the PlayStation 4 [2].","prompt":"Why do the new consoles that are coming out (PS4, XBox One) not have backwards compatibility?"}
{"chosen":"Moving air can make you feel cooler because of the heat loss from your skin. [1][2][3] The air around your skin conducts heat away from your body, and is also warmed by your skin. [2] As it warms, it loses moisture and becomes more humid. [2] Because of this, heat transfer is reduced as the air warms up, approaching the temperature of your skin. [2] As wind speed increases, the evaporation of moisture from your skin is also increased, leading to faster cooling. [3]","rejected":"Moving air cools you by evaporative cooling and wind chill [2][3][4]. When your body is warmer than the surrounding air, heat escapes from your body and warms up that air [2]. But if the air isn't moving, that air begins to warm up [2]. Heat transfer is faster if the temperature difference is greater [2]. As this warmed up air warms up your skin even more, less heat is transferred from your skin to the surrounding air [2]. However, if wind is blowing, it will move that warmed up air away and replace it with cool air [2]. This new patch of cool air will wick off heat from your skin more efficiently, making you feel cool [2].","prompt":"If particles move faster when heated, why does moving air make me feel cooler?\n\n"}
{"chosen":"Vitamin D is produced when ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation penetrates through the skin and converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), a molecule present throughout the skin but most highly concentrated in the lowest layers of the epidermis, into a chemical called preD3 [1]. Next, preD3 is converted into vitamin D3 when the vitamin D binding protein bonds with it and transports it into the blood through capillaries in the skin [1]. Vitamin D can last twice as long in the bloodstream as vitamin D consumed orally [3]. Moderate sun exposure is sufficient to produce enough vitamin D, assuming otherwise good health and nutrition [1]. People with darker skin have natural sun protection and need three to five times as much time in the sun to produce an equivalent amount of vitamin D as pale-skinned people [3]. Wearing sunscreen can reduce vitamin D production by as much as 95% [3]. During winter in much of the Northern Hemisphere, it is impossible to get enough sun exposure to generate sufficient vitamin D [3].","rejected":"Our bodies create vitamin D from direct sunlight on our skin when we're outdoors [1]. We also get some vitamin D from a small number of foods, including oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and sardines, as well as red meat and eggs [1].

{"chosen":"Vines use several different methods to climb up other structures. Some vines have tendrils, which are specialized plant parts that grow from the end of a leaf or the side of a stem. They grow straight until they contact something they can grasp, such as wire or cord, and then reflexively contract into a spiral and wrap around the support. [1]  Some plants, such as clematis, ascend by coiling leafstalks: as a stem grows and puts out foliage, the leafstalks of young leaves encircle anything slender they encounter, behaving more or less like tendrils. [2]  Other vines have specialized structures that allow them to grip their supports. Some vines, like trumpet vine and ivy, have stems equipped with aerial rootlets, while others, like Boston ivy, have tendrils that terminate in suction discs. [3]  Most vines use a combination of active and passive mechanisms to climb. Active mechanisms of attachment involve growth and hormonal responses called tropisms. Passively, vines can depend on existing structures like spines, stiff branches, patterns of growth, and simply sprawling over other plants. [4]","rejected":"Vines climb using tendrils, which are wiry structures along the plant's stem that reach out into the air until they come into contact with something they can grab onto. Once contact is made, the tendril curls, forming a coil, allowing the plant to adjust the degree of tension or pull on the support. Some vines have stems equipped with aerial rootlets, while others have tendrils that terminate in suction (holdfast) discs.[1,2] Vines have evolved to spread and climb to gain a competitive advantage. Oftentimes, they are seeking brighter light conditions by growing up a tree trunk to reach the higher sun exposure found in the canopies of trees. In some cases, the vining growth allows the species to colonize an area quickly without investing resources in producing supportive tissue (like a tree producing a trunk). In other species, the vine will want to have its roots in fertile soil with adequate moisture but also sought to grow in full sun conditions, possibly on a nearby rock exposure. This allows the vine to root in the fertile soil and climb over to the preferred sun exposure. Climbing vines can also have a competitive advantage as they will grow out of reach of potential herbivores. [3]","prompt":"how do climbing vines find structures or trees to climb up?"}
{"chosen":"While the traditional method of boarding airplanes from rear to front isefficient, it leads to the most aisle interferences [1]. This is due to the fact that today's travelers are taking more carry-ons with them because airlines have started charging for checked bags [2]. When you're at the front of the plane, there isn't enough overhead bin space for all the carry-ons [3]. So why haven't major airlines abandoned the annoying zone boarding system if there are clearly faster methods? It seems that carriers have little incentive to change the process because it allows them to sell boarding perks, like being first to get on the plane [4]. The challenge seems to be finding a seating method that is fast, but doesn't frustrate consumers or airline staff [4].","rejected":"Airlines traditionally board back-to-front because it is the most inefficient method, leading to the most aisle interactions [1].

{"chosen":"It turns out maggots do actually suppress our immune system [3]. When a fly is swatted, its body isn't destroyed but only a small part of it, so it is possible for the fly to regenerate most of its body [2]. One study found that maggots, the larval form of flies, thrive in chronic wounds because they suppress our immune system [3]. This allows the maggots to grow in the wounds without being attacked by our immune system [2, 3]. Maggots are also efficient consumers of dead tissue, so they munch on the rotting flesh of the fly's body, leaving the healthy tissue mostly unscathed [3]. Nowadays, maggots are used in maggot therapy, a prescription treatment for wounds that don't heal well [3].","rejected":"Most flies live between 15 and 25 days [1]. However, flies have a different perception of time than humans do. They have the ability to see objects up to four times faster than humans, meaning that a newspaper swat from their view happens in slow motion [1]. Factors affecting fly lifespan include food availability, temperature, and larval stage [2]. At moderate food levels, an adult house fly lives for about 45 - 50 days, but when they have an unlimited supply of food they can only last for 30-35 days [2]. In addition, in warmer temperatures, it takes 4 days for a larva to become an adult, but in colder temperatures, it can take up to 30 days [2].","prompt":"How can a fly nearly completely regenerate after it gets swatted?

Even if they don't receive a 1099, they still have to report the value of their winnings. [1]\nThere are additional issues associated with winning non-cash prizes. The winner of a non-cash prize is required to pay taxes on the fair market value of the prize.

{"chosen":"The simplest answer is that all the celestial bodies, including the planets, stars, and moons are spherical simply because the forces of nature are such that objects tend to form into spheres, whether they are celestial bodies or mere soap bubbles [1, 2]. In the case of soap bubbles, surface tension, which wants to make the bubble smaller in all directions, causes the spherical shape [2]. In the case of celestial objects, it is gravity that tries to collapse matter in all directions since all the atoms are pulled toward a common center of gravity [2]. The rapid rotation of most of the celestial bodies flattens out the middle and makes them wider across the equator than from pole to pole [3]. A star, like our sun for example, is made of a hot gas called plasma and is drawn into the center of the star due to gravity and is supported by the internal pressure inside the star [4].

{"chosen":"While freshly squeezed orange juice is rich in flavor, orange juice from concentrate lacks the same taste and smell due to the processes it goes through [1, 3, 4, 5]. When oranges are squeezed, the resulting juice is heated to eliminate any bacteria and then stored in vast tanks where oxygen is eliminated to prevent spoilage [4]. The resulting product is then seven times more concentrated than the initial juice and is therefore more efficient to transport and package [2]. To restore the flavor, fragrance companies create flavor packets that are added to the juice before it is packaged [5].","rejected":"The difference in taste between orange juice from concentrate and freshly squeezed orange juice is due to the different processes involved. The concentrate is produced by removing the excess water from the oranges, which is then pasteurized and frozen, resulting in a product that is seven times more concentrated than the initial juice [1, 3]. This process removes nearly all traces of flavor from the juice [1]. To restore flavor, flavor packs are added to the concentrate that use ingredients derived from oranges but have been extracted and isolated in labs and at levels not found in nature [2, 4]. Additionally, the storing and pasteurisation of orange juice affects the taste [4]. As a result, concentrate tends to have a stronger, more bitter taste due to the extra concentration of natural flavorings [4].","prompt":"Why does orange juice from concentrate taste so different?"}

In contrast, people with darker skin have a more difficult time acquiring adequate vitamin D, as their skin has a lower capacity to produce the vitamin. For example, melanin, the dark pigment in skin, competes with 7-DHC for the absorption of UV light and thus acts as a natural sunscreen, reducing the effectiveness of vitamin D production in skin. [1, 3] Additionally, sensible sun exposure, i.e., exposing bare arms and legs to midday sun (between 10 am and 3 pm) for 5-30 minutes twice weekly, may be sufficient to meet vitamin D requirements.

Leyden jars could discharge the static electricity they had stored up at a single moment in time [2]. In 1800, the Italian physicist Alessandra Volta found that certain chemical reactions could give rise to electrical charges [3]. Volta created an early electric battery, the voltaic pile, and in doing so Volta was later able to create a steady flow of electricity from one point to another [3]. In 1831, the English scientist Michael Faraday, who had been studying electrochemistry and electromagnetism, succeeded in creating the first ever electric dynamo [4]. Dynamos are power generators, and Faraday created the first one by using a magnet suspended in a coil of copper wire [4]. This set up enabled a small electrical current to flow across the wire, which cracked the problem of generating a constant electrical current [4].

The FBI affiant, Special Agent Daniel Genck, confirms the bombs used pressure cookers for their hulls [3]. However, because the Boston Bomber is an American citizen and the bombs were made and detonated in America, he was able to be charged under federal law rather than international law like Iraq was [1, 2, 3, 4].

One major reason is that the US government had gotten into the habit of calling anything explosive that could kill or hurt more than one person a 'weapon of mass destruction', whether it was biological, nuclear, chemical, or otherwise [3]. Another reason is that the Iraqi government had deceived UN inspectors in the past, and the record of the inspectors in finding Iraq's biological weapons was particularly weak [2].

The reason that violins don't have frets is that it would make it more difficult to play the instrument. Without delving into the complexities of physics, frets make it easier for performers to know where to place their fingers when they want to produce certain notes or chords. But without frets, the violin is able to produce tones that adhere to the equal temperament scale as well as others that do not divide the octave in this way [1].","rejected":"There are a couple of reasons guitars have frets and violins do not.

The second reason is that it is difficult to know where to place your fingers when you want to produce certain notes or chords, especially for beginners, and the frets make it easier [1]. However, once a greater technical fluency is achieved, the need for frets becomes less important [1]. As for cellos, they vary the pitch of each note using slight adjustments of the angle of their finger pad, and they are able to play three different notes on each pitch, making their playing perfectly in tune with the key that they are in [2].

There are also moderate evidence that regular marijuana users are more likely to experience suicidal thoughts, and there is a small increased risk of depression among marijuana users [2]. Marijuana smoking is linked to increased risk of chronic cough, but it is unclear whether smoking marijuana worsens lung function or increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma [3]. A 2014 study that explored the relationship between marijuana use and lung disease suggested that it was plausible that smoking marijuana could contribute to lung cancer, though it has been difficult to conclusively link the two [3].

Many insects successfully pass the winter as immature larvae, protected by heavy covers of leaf litter or similar shelters [1]. Some insects overwinter in the pupal stage, then emerge as adults in the spring [2]. Moths in the Silkworm Family, Saturniidae, may be found attached to food plant branches as pupae in the winter [2]. Many insects hibernate as adults, seeking shelter in the eaves and attics of houses or barns [2]. Tree holes, leaf litter, and under logs and rocks are common shelters for overwintering adult insects [2, 3]. The Mourning Cloak Butterfly is usually the first butterfly that is noticed in the Spring, and this is because it hibernates in tree holes or other shelters during the winter [2, 3].

The aim is for the missile to seek out the heat signature from the flare rather than the aircraft's engines [1].

After decoy flares are fired, the aircraft ideally pulls away at a sharp angle from the point where the flares were fired to minimize the thermal signature [2]. Engine power can also be reduced to control or minimize the thermal signature [2]. Modern heat-seeking missiles have been modified to become more versatile and can now sense different ranges of infrared to ensure they reach their target and not a decoy [4].

The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes [3]. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created [3]. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object [3]. 3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing, which is cutting out \/ hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic using a milling machine [3]. 3D printing enables you to produce complex shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods [3]. Another technology used in 3D printing is stereolithography [4]. In it, a UV laser is shined into a vat of ultraviolet-sensitive photopolymer, tracing the object to be created on its surface [4]. The polymer solidifies wherever the beam touches it, and the beam \"prints\" the object layer by layer [4].","rejected":"3D printing is an additive manufacturing technology where a 3D object is created by laying down layers of material.

[1] The majority of studies that have found amphibians in salt water habitats have recorded them from coastal areas that get flooded predictably by sea water. For example, mangrove swamps are flooded daily by tidal fluctuations, so predictable levels of salt water in surrounding standing water. The most well-known frog to inhabit such environments is the crab-eating frog (Fejervarya cancrivora) of Southeast Asia. This unique species can live in freshwater as well as 75 percent seawater and can adapt from one to the other in a matter of hours. It is able to achieve this by rapidly changing levels of urea in its body tissues, which avoids excessive water loss through the skin in salty conditions. In addition, it has three glands within its skin: mucous glands, mixed glands, and vacuolated glands, which help buffer the additional salt which would otherwise enter its body.

{"chosen":"The mouth bleeds similarly to how other parts of the body bleed. There are four main stages to healing a wound: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and epithelialization [3]. The first stage of healing is stopping the bleeding by forming a blood clot, also known as a thrombus [3]. Blood vessels constrict to restrict blood flow, and platelets stick together to seal the wound [3]. Finally, threads of fibrin reinforce the seal through a process called coagulation [3]. The second stage of healing involves the injured blood vessels discharging a fluid that causes the wound to swell, and the repair process starts by removing damaged cells and bacteria [3]. Inflammation helps stop further bleeding and ward off infection, and it only becomes problematic if prolonged or excessive [3]. Granulation tissue forms in the third stage of healing, and the wound contracts as these new tissues are built [3].

This generator produces electric current, which is the flow of electrons in a circuit [4]. The current travels through transmission lines to substations, where the voltage is lowered and sent through distribution lines [2]. Electric wires provide resistance to the electric current, so bringing resistance into the picture clearly defines how transmission and voltage work together [3]. Ohms law states that electric current is directly proportional to the voltage, while the current is inversely proportional to the resistance [3].

{"chosen":"There are two main barriers preventing us from using the heat from the Earth's core to power steam turbines and generate clean energy. First, the design of the turbines requires a relatively constant temperature, and the rocks deep in the Earth's crust cool down too fast [2]. Second, because the heat is generated by pumping water down at high pressure to exploit fissures in the rock so that water can then conduct heat from a wider area [3], the costs of drilling and maintaining the wells required for geothermal energy are too high [5, 6]. In the United States, the only areas east of the Mississippi that could potentially meet the needs of a Power Tube are too shallow [4]. The process is also limited by how quickly the surrounding rock cools down and new heat is generated [2].","rejected":"The heat from the Earth's core can be used to produce geothermal energy that can be used to heat homes and produce electricity [1, 2, 3].

The core itself has two layers: a solid iron core and an outer core made of very hot melted rock, called magma [3]. The mantle that surrounds the core and is about 1,800 miles thick is made up of magma and rock [3]. Magma comes close to the earth's surface near the edges of these plates, which is where volcanoes occur [3]. The lava that erupts from volcanoes is partly magma, and deep underground, the rocks and water absorb the heat from this magma [3]. As a result, the temperature of the rocks and water get hotter and hotter as you go deeper underground [3].","prompt":"Why can't we use the heat from the Earth's core to power steam turbines and generate clean energy?"}

{"chosen":"Long-range rockets require more complex calculations than those for short-range rockets, due to air resistance and the Earth not being flat [1]. Even ignoring air resistance, gravity does not pull objects straight down; instead, it pulls them toward the center of the Earth, whose direction changes as the projectile moves further down-range, away from the launch site [1]. As a result, the rocket has to tilt to the side as it travels into the sky in order to curve its flight into orbit [2, 3]. This steering technique is known as a gravity turn, which uses Earth's gravity to help conserve rocket fuel and minimize stress and strain on the spacecraft [3, 4].","rejected":"Rockets follow a curved trajectory to reach the planet's orbit and then stay there. In the planet's orbit, the gravitational tug of the planet is high enough to keep the rocket from drifting off into outer space, and low enough so the rocket doesn't have to burn huge amounts of fuel to keep itself from plummeting back to Earth. [2] To enter orbit, a rocket begins to tilt onto its side at first, and gradually increases this tilt until it achieves an elliptical orbit around Earth. A rocket starts to turn gradually to enter the orbit, and it can maintain a very low or even zero angle of attack during the early stages of its ascent, meaning that the rocket experiences less aerodynamic stress. It also lets the rocket use Earth\u2019s gravity, rather than its own fuel, to change its direction.

{"chosen":"Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, but the way these atoms bond together makes water a unique substance that cannot burn [1, 2, 3, 4]. When hydrogen bonds with oxygen, the result is a molecule with entirely different properties from either of the original hydrogen and oxygen atoms [1]. Specifically, when water burns, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms bond together to form H2O, or water [2, 4]. This reaction requires both hydrogen and oxygen to be present, and once it happens, the hydrogen and oxygen atoms will not bond to any more oxygen atoms [3]. This means that once water has been created, it cannot be further oxidized, or burned, by adding more oxygen [3]. This is the reason that water can be used to put out fires rather than starting them [1].

[3].  For example, in one study, a 5% drop in measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage led to a threefold increase in measles cases each year. This is because even kids who have been vaccinated may be at a small risk if there is a child in the community who has the illness.

Marx contrasted capitalist economies to \"socialist\" ones, which vest more power in the political system.

{"chosen":"The bubbles that form when running water encounters soap are caused by the soap molecules. Soap molecules have a \"head\" that likes water and a \"tail\" that does not [2]. The head of the soap molecule likes to stick to water, while the tail doesn't like water and prefers to stay in the air [2]. When a bubble forms, surface tension is also at work. Surface tension is the force that makes water behave as if it were a thin sheet of rubber [2]. The surfactant molecules push their way between water molecules, separating them from one another, and reducing their attractive force [2]. As a result, the soap helps spread the water out into a thin film that forms a sphere: the bubble [2]. The surface tension of water is high, but when soap is added to water it lowers the tension [2]. Hard water contains calcium and magnesium ions, which make it more difficult to rinse soap off your body [3]. Soap lathers better in soft water than in hard water, so it's easy to use too much [3].

The molecules in a piece of paper, for instance, are far too small to be affected by the scissor's edge, and they just move out of the way [1]. Essentially, when you cut something, the surface tension of the atoms is what holds the pieces together [3, 4]. There is an imbalance of intermolecular attractive forces, the cohesive forces between molecules, in a liquid, and this causes the molecules to move away from each other [4].

This means that for tasks that take different amounts of time to complete, the bar will move at different speeds [3]. Another reason is that humans do not perceive time in a linear way [3,5]. Since the bar moves at different speeds for different tasks, it can make users feel like the progress is happening faster or slower than it actually is [5].

You should inform the lab before taking the paternity test if you have recently had a blood transfusion or organ transplant [2]. New DNA introduced from a blood transfusion or organ transplant may alter the results of a paternity test [2]. Laser pulse Doppler velocimetry is used in a prenatal test to measure blood flow through the uterine artery [3].

Some have speculated that the reason the media did not report on Wilson's injuries is because it would be to the advantage of the protesters to portray him as a racist and brutal cop rather than a victim of Brown's attack [4].

First, they played back the sounds for study participants while monitoring certain indicators of stress, like heart rate, blood pressure, and the electrical conductivity of skin. They found the offensive sounds indeed changed the listeners' skin conductivity, indicating they cause a measureable physical stress reaction. [3]  The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to watch how the brains of 13 participants responded to different sounds. They found that any sound between 2000-5000 Hz was perceived as unpleasant by the participants. While this is the range where our ears are most sensitive, it also includes the sounds of screams, which we find intrinsically unpleasant. [2]    Another theory regarding our dislike of the sound of Styrofoam rubbing together, is that the amygdala, the emotional part of the brain, takes charge and modulates the activity of the auditory part of the brain in such a way that our perception of a negative sound is heightened when compared to a pleasing sound. [1][2]","rejected":"Researchers have known for a number of years that many of the sounds that are most unpleasant to the human ear occur between two and four kilohertz, the range spanned roughly by the highest octave on a piano.

This hypothesis is one that has been explored before in monkeys, and the one species that was examined did not demonstrate the same aversion to these sounds as humans. [2]  In a new study, scientists reveal what is actually going on in the brain to make us recoil at certain noises.

{"chosen":"In the past, people made judgements regarding other races based on physical traits such as facial features, skin color, hair texture, and eye color. These traits may be more prominent in some racial groups than in others, but they do not necessarily define how people from different racial backgrounds differ from one another. [1, 2, 3] In addition the social distinction of race often involves a person's self-identification as well as history, culture, and traditions. [2] However, how people are categorized by racial groups is not necessarily connected to a belief that these groups share some essential, overriding physical or behavioral traits. Research has shown that children tend to believe that racial categories are meaningful and that racial traits define the essential characteristics of the people in those categories. [4] Nonetheless, within a given race, physical traits may vary to a greater or lesser extent, making it difficult to define borders between different categories.

The scale caused by hard water has detrimental effects similar to those seen with temporary hard water, such as obstruction of water flow in pipes [2]. Permanent hard water consists of high concentrations of anions, like the sulfate anion (SO_4^2-), which cannot be removed simply by boiling the water and thereby precipitating out the mineral ions [2].

As you turn on the rice cooker, the heating pad will heat the bowl by delivering heat to the water and rice [4]. Once the water starts boiling, steam starts to form and rise from the bowl [4]. Along with the steam, there is heat that goes along it, so the temperature at the bowl's bottom is maintained within a safer perimeter and doesn't get higher than 212 degrees Fahrenheit [4].

It also predicts that there are extra dimensions to space beyond the obvious length, breadth, and depth, but we do not experience them because they are bunched up in tiny spaces [2]. Some recent versions of the theory have predicted that the strings could have a longer length, up to nearly a millimeter in size, which would mean they're in the realm that experiments could detect them [5]. The formulas that result from string theory predict more than four dimensions (10 or 11 in the most common variants, though one version requires 26 dimensions), but the extra dimensions are \"curled up\" within the Planck length [6]. String theory was initially developed in the 1970s in an attempt to explain some inconsistencies with the energy behavior of hadrons and other fundamental particles of physics [7].","rejected":"String theory is a theoretical framework that attempts to address various questions about fundamental physics [1]. The starting point for string theory is the idea that point-like particles of particle physics can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings [1]. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other [1]. In a given version of string theory, there is only one kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways [1]. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string [1]. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings [1]. One of the main developments of recent decades in string theory was the discovery of certain dualities, which are mathematical transformations that identify one physical theory with another [2]. This has led to the conjecture that all consistent versions of string theory may exist in just one universe [2]. Some physicists, however, think that this feature of string theory may instead provide an explanation for why our universe is so well suited to life [3, 4].

Secondly, central banks enact monetary policy, by easing or tightening the money supply and availability of credit, as they seek to keep a nation's economy on an even keel [2]. This causes prices for a given class of assets or goods to overshoot the implied market equilibrium prices and remain persistently high and continues to climb rather than correcting toward the expected prices [4].

Your brain is always predicting what's going to happen next, and when the long-awaited chord is heard, your brain sighs with dopamine-soaked satisfaction [2]. This may explain why some people get chills when listening to music. Research has found that these people have more nerve fibers connecting their auditory cortex, which processes sound, to their anterior insular cortex, a region involved in processing feelings [3]. The auditory cortex also has strong links to parts of the brain that may monitor emotions [3]. It's possible that the connectivity between the auditory cortex and these other regions is allowing music to have a profound emotional response in these people [4].","rejected":"Studies suggest that the phenomenon of getting chills when listening to music or being excited about something is linked to dopamine, a chemical in the brain associated with food, sex, and drugs.

In ASMR role plays, the ASMRtist often creates a sense of personal intimacy with the viewer, often with close contact and detailed attention to the viewer. This personal attention may trigger an oxytocin release in the brain, which again might be related to tingles.

Furthermore, cell phone calls require a good codec operating on a good network to produce high-quality sound, and different carriers have different codecs that work best on their networks [3].

The newly formed Moral Majority, orchestrated by radio and television preachers such as televangelist Jerry Falwell, used scare tactics to promote its platform.

Because the Gregorian calendar was linked to Christianity, it was not widely used until Charlemagne made it official for the Holy Roman Empire in the ninth century A.D. [1]. By the twelfth century, England had also begun using the system, which spread around the world with European colonization [1].  Although many non-Christian religions retain their own calendars for religious purposes, the Gregorian calendar is used worldwide for commercial purposes [2, 3].

The image or text is then recreated on to the page using a series of miniscule dots. The only real difference that separates the various types of machines available is the method in which the dots are transferred onto the page. [1] \n Inkjet machines use a liquid ink produced either by a coloured dye or a liquid that contains solid pigments in suspension. As the print head moves horizontally in the machine, the paper passes through perpendicular to it. As the page passes through, the individual holes in the print head are activated (usually by heat electrical current depending on the manufacturer) and a small drop of ink is pushed out onto the page. This process if performed at high speed with thousands of droplets that form together to recreate the digital text or image that is being transferred onto the media.

Laser printers work by using a rotating cylinder coated with a photosensitive electrically charged material and a series of mirrors. When a document is sent to a laser printer, the laser light is reflected by the mirrors on to the cylinder, which neutralizes electric charges in specific areas. As a result, when the toner particles hit the cylinder, they only stick to the areas exposed to the laser light. [1] Inkjet printers use liquid ink instead of solid toner particles.

{"chosen":"Nasal congestion is common and often caused by mucous build-up during sleep. Once the body is active and moving, the increased circulation helps to clear sinus pressure and allows for easier breathing [1]. During exercise, the blood flow to the tiny blood vessels in the nose starts to slow down, which shrinks the tissues responsible for creating mucus, while also widening the air passages [3]. This increased air flow and temperature in the body's core helps to relieve sinus pressure and congestion [1,3]. However, once exercise is over, blood will rush back to those little blood vessels in the nasal tissue, possibly filling them up too much and causing them to dilate, partially blocking the airways and making the person feel stuffy [4]. In addition, the body loses heat and water during exercise, which can cause cells to release histamines into the blood stream and trigger an allergic reaction [4].","rejected":"Running or doing other exercises can temporarily relieve nasal congestion due to various reasons.

Such motors attempt to use permanent magnets in the stator and rotor to generate a perpetual rotational movement [1, 2].  This is supposed to work because like poles repel each other, while opposite poles attract each other [3].  Proponents of these types of motors argue that the magnets contain stored magnetic energy, or that the magnetic force acting on the magnets is the source of propulsion [2]. However, these arguments ignore the fact that there is no substantial energy in magnets, and after a short amount of time, the motor will stop moving and assume an equilibrium position [2]. Furthermore, the force between permanent magnets is conservative, and no work is done over a closed cycle, meaning that there is no way to create a perpetual motion machine [2, 3].","rejected":"There is no such thing as a magnet-based engine.

The federal government was using \u2014 and still uses \u2014 a very sophisticated method of accounting that I like to call \u201cpolitical math.\u201d  Excluding Social Security obligations from the national debt allowed the White House to claim a surplus while the government\u2019s financial obligations were actually increasing (this practice still exists, with the official national debt figures omitting $83 trillion in future Social Security bills). This financial approach is not dissimilar to infamous Enron accounting methods, where huge liabilities are not included on balance sheets.  In the federal government\u2019s case, vast sums promised and owed for future Social Security and Medicare recipients are kept off the balance sheet. Taxpayers believe the money taken out of their paychecks is being held in trust, though that's not the case. Clinton was able to claim surpluses, because the Treasury Department was recording this money as revenue.

This lead to a period of budget surpluses.  [2][3]  The second phase started in 2001 when the tech bubble burst, causing a spike in the budget deficit.  [2][3] Discretionary spending increased dramatically due to the 9\/11 attacks and increased defense expenditures, and there were also increases in mandatory spending.

{"chosen":"Cells communicate with each other locally by direct contact between cells or through cell-cell recognition [1]. For example, when an animal cell comes into contact with a signaling cell, molecules on the signaling cell's membrane can directly contact molecules on the animal cell's surface [1]. The signaling cell can also secrete messenger molecules that travel only short distances before binding to receptors on nearby cells [1]. Long-distance signaling occurs either endocrine or paracrine [2, 3, 4]. Hormones are used for long-distance signaling between cells, tissues, and glands that produce the hormones and cells that express the matching hormone receptors [2, 3]. On the other hand, paracrine signaling involves a signaling molecule secreted by one cell that diffuses to another cell in the local neighborhood [4].","rejected":"Cells communicate with each other using chemicals called signalling molecules [1]. The cell secretes these molecules out and other cells detect the presence of the signalling molecule through receptors present on their surface [1].

Every cell has receptors that can detect a lot of different signals, so they are constantly bombarded with biological conversation [2]. Proteins and glycoproteins on cell surfaces play a major role in how cells interact with their surroundings and with other cells [3]. Some of the proteins in the glycocalyx of adjacent cells interact to form cell-cell junctions, while others interact with extracellular proteins and carbohydrates to form the extracellular matrix (ECM) [3]. Still others are part of receptor systems that bind hormones and other signaling molecules at the cell surface, conveying information into the cell by signal transduction [3].","prompt":"How cells communicate locally and long distance in animals.\n\nI was always just curious to know how our human bodies worked.

{"chosen":"Litter size is determined by a number of factors, including the optimal size of the offspring and the space inside the mother's body available for the developing offspring. [1] Various mammals can have litters of different sizes, from two to dozens, depending on species. [1, 2] For example, mice are r-selected organisms that may produce dozens of young in a year, while humans, who have no more than one offspring per year, are K-selected. [1] Also, creatures often display group behavior, with offspring benefiting from the protection of a larger group. With multiple young, predators can eat several and others may still survive to reach maturity, but with only one offspring, its loss could mean a wasted breeding season. The other significant advantage is the chance for the healthiest young animals to be favored from a group. Rather than it being a conscious decision on the part of the parents, the fittest and strongest baby competes most successfully for food and space, leaving the weakest young, or runts, to die.

[1] Moreover, many animals produce multiple babies quickly and repeatedly to ensure that at least a few of their offspring will survive to replace them. These animals are referred to as r-strategists, whereas animals that live in controlled environments, such as farm animals, are called K-strategists.

Then, bcrypt runs an expensive key schedule which consists of performing a key derivation where we derive a set of subkeys from a primary key [1]. The password is used as the primary key [1]. In the event that the user selected a bad or short password, we stretch that password\/key into a longer password\/key [1].

This practice is also known as key stretching [1]. The salt is incorporated into the hash [2]. The compare function simply pulls the salt out of the hash and then uses it to hash the password and perform the comparison [2]. Bcrypt was designed as an improvement to the Blowfish password hashing algorithm to reduce the likelihood of 1) brute force attacks and 2) rainbow table attacks becoming successful [3]. It adds an additional cushion of security by modifying the Blowfish key setup in such a way that is more time consuming to produce a key [3]. Bcrypt effectively added more rounds in its hashing function when computing the hash by making the number of rounds configurable and thereby making it a slower hash, and effectively strengthening the key [3].","prompt":"How does bcrypt work?\n\nNot specific enough?

Nonetheless, the advent of the mechanical ventilator, which pushes air into and out of the lungs, created a new category called brain death [2]. A person must have irreversibly lost function in all parts of his or her brain to be declared brain-dead [2]. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation can revive people many minutes after their heart stops beating, often with no lasting brain damage, so doctors should perform CPR for at least 38 minutes, a 2013 study presented at the American Heart Association meeting found [3]. However, some death determinations require a doctor to make a choice to intervene, or stop fighting, some cases can cause controversy [4].","rejected":"Often, people are considered donors only after it is clear that they have no hope of survival [3].

[2] Elements with fewer protons are stable if they have the same number of neutrons, but as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, more neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus stable. [2]  For example, lead-206 has 82 protons and 124 neutrons, which keeps it stable. [2] However, a nucleus can be unstable if it has too many or too few neutrons. [2]  This is why some elements, such as uranium, have to have so many neutrons in order to be stable. [3]","rejected":"Neutrons are part of the nucleus and they help make the nucleus stable.

[1]  The nuclear force is greater than the electrostatic force of repulsion so small nuclei are stable.

{"chosen":"When a guitar string is plucked, its vibration is transmitted from the bridge, resonating throughout the top of the guitar [1]. The strings themselves don't displace a whole lot of air due to the small surface area of the strings, so this produces only a small amount of sound, as evidenced when playing an electric guitar unplugged [2]. However, the saddle is embedded in the bridge which is attached to the soundboard of the guitar which has a much larger surface area [2]. As the soundboard resonates with the vibration of the strings, more air particles are displaced [3]. This is due to the larger surface area of the soundboard [3]. The transfer of energy eventually resulting in greater amplitude (volume) may seem strange given the energy imparted on the strings is transferred to the much larger surface area of the soundboard to produce sound [3]. But there's no magic involved, the trade off in transferring the energy of the strings to the soundboard is a loss of sustain [3].","rejected":"A guitar string has a number of frequencies at which it will naturally vibrate, known as the harmonics of the guitar string.

There are times when an instrument interferes with another instrument, or malfunctions and sends confusing signals to ground staff; in such cases the offending instrument has to be disabled [1, 3]. Additionally, instruments have to be adjusted and even recalibrated in-flight, so the ability to do so must be a part of their user interface [1, 3].

In addition, people don't need such powerful grip strength because our diets have also shifted toward cooked grains, but human diets still allow for eating raw foods and carrying heavy objects [1]. Our bodies are also less hairy, and muscles such as arrector pili that produce goosebumps when they contract are no longer beneficial [2, 3].

{"chosen":"Water can be considered a renewable resource despite human activities impacting its availability and quality because water is a part of a natural cycle. Water evaporates from the Earth's surface and goes up into the atmosphere where it condenses. It then falls back onto the Earth as rain or snow and is deposited in rivers, lakes, porous rock and the ocean. [1] This water can stay in the atmosphere for up to 9 days, but it can stay in a river for up to 6 months and up to hundreds of years in lakes or the ocean. [1] Despite this natural cycle, humans impact water resources because we use much more water than what is naturally available. We use this water for daily lives and a lot of the water we use cannot be reused because we have polluted it. [1] Furthermore, there are many examples of water being wasted on lawns and other consumptive uses that ultimately evaporate or transpire. [3]","rejected":"Water is a renewable resource because it evaporates out of the oceans to clouds, which generate rain falling on the land. The water then runs into rivers and dams where it is used and the waste is partially cleaned before it [1].\n\nAnimal agriculture is responsible for 20 to 33 percent of all fresh water consumption in the world [2]. Because animals are so densely packed on today\u2019s industrial farms, they produce more manure than can be absorbed by the land as fertilizer. The runoff from these facilities grossly contaminates rivers and ground water [2]. Tyson, America\u2019s largest meat producer, is responsible for dumping more toxic pollutants into our waterways than companies like ExxonMobil and Dow Chemical [2]. Animal excrement and agricultural runoff have polluted nearly one-third of rivers in the U.S [2].","prompt":"How can water be wasted if it is a renewable resource?\n\nI frequently see different sources promote use of less water to be less \"wasteful\" eg. Vegans often promote plants because they take less water to grow than animals, politicians asking\/forcing people in drought areas to use less on their lawns. I am referring specifically to water that is not from a municipal\/tap type system, like collected groundwater often used for irrigation."}

{"chosen":"This phenomenon is known as the \"wagon-wheel\" effect [1]. It happens when a camera records footage at a specified frame rate and the frequency of a wheel's spin matches the frame rate (say, 24 revolutions per second) [1]. With many movie cameras, that rate is 24 frames per second. When the spoke completes a full revolution every 1\/24 seconds, the wheel appears motionless [1]. This is because each spoke comes up a few degrees shy of the position it occupied when it was last imaged by the camera [2]. But if the spoke overshoots, the wheel will appear to rotate in the right direction, but very, very slowly [2]. Some scientists posit that the effect is a result of perceptual rivalry [3]. This occurs when the brain creates two different interpretations of one situation to explain an ambiguous scene [3]. The perception that is dominant is what we \"believe\" in this case (that the wheel is actually spinning backwards) [3].","rejected":"This effect is known as the \"wagon-wheel effect,\" wherein the rotating object appears to be rotating in the opposite direction [4]. There are several different explanations for this effect, but the one most scientists agree with is that our brain computes motion by taking a series of still images and filling in the gaps between those still images with an illusion of continuous movement between similar images [1, 3]. Therefore, if the wheel rotates most of the way along one frame to the next, the most apparent direction of motion for the brain to comprehend is backwards [1]. Another factor that can affect this perception is the camera's settings - for example, if the camera is set to a high frame rate, the effect will be less noticeable than if it is set to a low frame rate [4].","prompt":"Why is it when something is spinning and gets going faster and faster it starts to look like it is spinning the other way?\n\n"}
{"chosen":"Historically, there were two reasons why people didn't smile in photographs. First, photography took guidance from pre-existing customs in painting, and in painting, smiling was considered an inappropriate expression for portraiture [1, 2]. Smiling was \"associated with madness, lewdness, loudness, drunkenness, all sorts of states of being that were not particularly decorous\" [1]. Secondly, having your photograph taken was a luxury and not something that everyone could do, and the etiquette for these formal occasions may have been to not smile [2]. The fact that portraits were so expensive may also have played a role in dissuading people from smiling [2]. Kodak had to circulate how-to books and encourage people to just click the shutter, and its technicians would do the job of developing and processing the prints [4]. Once magazines like Life saw that it was possible to take natural-looking photos, people began to realise that smiling was okay [4].","rejected":"Although many assume that people didn't smile in old photos because they were uncomfortable or embarrassed to do so, there are other factors that may have influenced this lack of smiles. One reason is dental: some dismiss the idea that bad teeth could have been a possible cause for early photography's close-lipped images, since that was a common condition and wouldn't have necessarily been noteworthy at the time. However, Angus Trumble, the director of the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, Australia, and author of A Brief History of the Smile, disagrees. He points to the professionalization of dental health as one factor leading to the rise of smiles, arguing that just because bad teeth were normal didn't mean they were desirable. \"People had lousy teeth, if they had teeth at all, which militated against opening your mouth in social settings,\" he says. [1] Another reason people may not have smiled in photos is that it took a long time to capture an image, and people couldn't hold a smile for that long. However, Todd Gustavson, technology curator at the George Eastman Museum, disputes this, saying that technology has been overplayed as the limiting factor. By the 1850s and '60s it was possible in the right conditions to take photographs with only","prompt":"Why was it unpopular to smile while you had your picture taken?"}
{"chosen":"There are several factors that have led to video games, and subsequently eSports, being popular in South Korea. A big reason is the country's high internet speed. [1] Because South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, with widespread and extremely fast broadband internet access, South Korean gamers were able to play on faster internet and make more moves within the game than gamers from other countries. [1] Another reason is that the South Korean government invested in internet infrastructure after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. This led to the creation of broadband networks, which in turn led to an accidental renaissance era for esports, as video games proved to be a fantastic way to distance oneself from the financial realities of the time. [3, 5] Additionally, PC Bangs (internet cafes) were born due to the relative expense of PCs and internet access at the turn of the millennium, and they allowed for affordable access to the games young people wanted to play on high-end PCs. Game developers also usually encouraged people to play from them by offering in-game perks.

Esports in South Korea became popular for a number of reasons, including government investment in Internet infrastructure and the building of broadband networks [1, 2]. Some researchers attribute the popularity of esports in South Korea to cultural appetites, arguing that the fast-paced action and quick decisions demanded by video games such as StarCraft are a modern version of a traditional Korean game [3].

{"chosen":"A medically induced coma is when a doctor uses drugs to induce a coma so the patient can undergo surgery or procedures that would otherwise be impossible due to the patient being awake and moving around [1, 2, 3]. The purpose of a medically induced coma is to allow the brain to heal without the body performing radical triage by shutting off blood flow to damaged sections [1]. A drug is administered and, once the patient is under, the anesthesiologist will monitor brain activity and adjust the dosage as needed to maintain the target brain activity level [2, 3]. Eventually, the patient will be brought out of the coma once the doctor determines it is safe to do so [3].","rejected":"In the case of a medically induced coma, doctors aim to halt blood flow entirely so that they can perform surgery on the aorta [1]. Often, the same drugs are used to induce a coma as those used to put a patient under for surgery [1, 3]. These drugs are powerful anesthetics that take the brain to a state of deep unconsciousness [3]. An EEG monitors brain activity and once the brain's activity reaches the goal level, a machine will continue to deliver precise doses of anesthetic [3]. Doctors will keep a patient in a coma for as long as necessary, usually less than a week [2, 3]. Often, a coma lasts only a few days [3].","prompt":"How do hospitals get patients into an induced coma?"}
{"chosen":"A nebula is a giant cloud of dust and gas in space [1]. Some nebulae (more than one nebula) come from the gas and dust thrown out by the explosion of a dying star, such as a supernova [1]. Other nebulae are regions where new stars are beginning to form [1]. For this reason, some nebulae are called \"star nurseries\" [1]. Nebulae are made of dust and gases\u2014mostly hydrogen and helium [2]. The dust and gases in a nebula are very spread out, but gravity can slowly begin to pull together clumps of dust and gas [2]. As these clumps get bigger and bigger, their gravity gets stronger and stronger [2]. Eventually, the clump of dust and gas gets so big that it collapses from its own gravity. The collapse causes the material at the center of the cloud to heat up, and this hot core is the beginning of a star [2].","rejected":" Several reasons contribute to how Nebulas take on shapes and just float around in space together. First is that Nebulae come in an extraordinary variety of shapes, colors, and sizes making them some of the most spectacular and fascinating objects in our universe [1]. The names they are given often reflect the familiar shapes they form into [1]. Secondly, Nebulae provide the material and environments from which stars are born, forming the basis from which entire planetary systems can take shape [1]. The abundance of hydrogen gas within nebulae provides the platform from which stars are created and the tiny dust particles eventually form into orbiting bodies around the new stars [1]. Finally, once these very same stars die, the process will continue as the matter they eject into interstellar space will form into new nebulae [2]. Finally, nebulae take on shapes and just float around in space together due to chance gravitational interactions or being too close to a nearby supernova [3].

First-degree attempted murder carries greater penalties and often means a life sentence with the possibility of parole [3]. Offenders typically spend at least 10 years in prison, although mandatory minimum sentences for attempting to murder a public official may be 10 to 15 years [3]. Federal laws for attempting to kill a member of Congress or other federal official impose penalties ranging from 70 to 162 months [3]. Second-degree attempted murder penalties usually range from five years to 15 years, depending on whether serious injury was inflicted [3]. Sentences can be for longer periods if a firearm was used or if the crime was committed by a gang member or at the direction of a criminal gang [3].
